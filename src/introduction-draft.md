# Introduction (draft)

I will begin by providing a layered context, summary of the environment that I and any other biomedical engineering student or neuroscience graduate student would find himself in 2012 at the start of my PhD.

Role of  engineer is assisting specialists, physicians and scientist  with focused knowledge and well defined objectives, and also close familiarity with the barriers/difficulties that occasionally or persistently impede their best efforts towards achieving those objectives. 
The unwavering expansion and global distribution of information can Cross fields of study 2 stimulate insight and occasionally fuel sudden and rapid acquisition of profound knowledge that - with luck - will bestow on vigilant specialists who are sufficiently attentive, active and well prepared, a greater capacity and opportunity 2 improve lives and extended future 4 human (and mice).

And while I work knowledge of cause and effect mysteries of the world is substantial and critical to addressing problems that interfere with equally in is the similarly accelerated expansion our technological capability 2 address those problems.

Finally and most importantly I mention the seemingly overlooked or tragically forgotten avenue critical to the continuation of progress, the substantial decreasing costs and availability of the technology that we have useful in biomedical undertakings.

I'm making the point that the context that I find one where there is the general persistent need  shared scientists and doctors alike to be better better equipped 2 reach their objectives perform the things they want to do. A statement of fact, but hardly worth mentioning I'm just describing the situation that every  human with an aspiration to continue being human as exhibited ever. However what I wish to emphasize is that our perpetual desire 2 be better at what we do normally to wreck problems unique to our
