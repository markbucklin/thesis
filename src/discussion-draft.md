# Discussion (draft)

This is a draft of the discussion dictated on my phone in a small notes program. The Thesis will have 2 discussion sections, the first following the initial microscope hardware and image processing software sections which are largely completed at this time, and II at the end of the document.

## Middle Discussion

### Assessment of Long-Term Viability of Current Approach


## Closing Discussion



### unintentionally neuromorphic

I wish to discuss a few other parallels that aren't as obvious for as relevant to the planning and approach of the software, which is why they have not been brought up before but included here because they're interesting regardless, especially from a neuroscience perspective.
