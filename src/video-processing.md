## phases

### preprocessing
Image filtering operations
Normalization
Motion estimation and compensation
Layer classification
  foreground/background
  Cell/neuropil/vessel


#### time series analysis
Prediction and factorization of temporal components/contaminants
Model:
  Unidirectional trend (sources...)
  Oscillatory ("seasonal")
  Unpredictable


#### spatial signal deconvolution (unmixing)

### signal localization and extraction
Segmentation of cells
Overlap and "disconnected" regions
Initial vs incremental cell identification

### active signal analysis
Signal statistics
  Shape and stability of probabilistic distribution
Pixel level vs cell level

#### independent cellular activity measures
Quality
Complexity
Spatial
Temporal

#### network analysis

## Computing cost:

  boundary analysis for iOS and config

## Storage cost:

  compression and imposed boundaries
