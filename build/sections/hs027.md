### Project Plan

Deep brain stimulation  (DBS) has revolutionized the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases over the past couple decades. A DBS device is essentially a cardiac pacemaker reconfigured to stimulate a small region of brain near the tip of an electrode with high-frequency pulses of electrical current; despite this simplicity, DBS has been used widely for treating movement disorders, such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease  (PD) and dystonia. The impressive performance of DBS on alleviating movement deficits associated with PD and dystonia has motivated a number of ongoing clinical trials on assessing its use in treating other brain disorders, such as obsessive compulsive disorder and depression. However, benefits of DBS treatment are unpredictable and show varying degrees and patterns of symptom suppression across patients. Unfortunately, this technology in its current iteration has been unable to overcome these limitations. This is likely due in part to a need for neural implant devices that are capable of more numerous and specific stimulation contact areas. Additionally, the DBS mechanism of action remains unknown and this further limits its ability to become wholly sufficient treatment. The central goal of this project is to develop a novel adaptive neuromodulation platform with increased neural contacts and their specificity as well as to examine the therapeutic mechanisms of DBS. My hypothesis was that aberrant neural network dynamics underlie the behavioral symptoms of brain disorders, and DBS therapeutic effect is through scrambling pathological neural network patterns. While I would primarily focus on PD here, the principles discovered through this study should be easily generalized to design novel therapies for other neurological and psychiatric disorders.
