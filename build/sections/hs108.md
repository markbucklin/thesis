### Managing Continuity

Data such as baseline frames and frames for alignment must be passed between parallel processors to maintain continuity between data divided temporally between processors. However, the efficient application of this approach was limited by the system memory and number of cores available, and was meant to be applied in a cluster environment.

Building the set of functions for offline processing enabled application to data already gathered, and also served as a framework that informed the necessary procedures to be included in the online extension of this toolbox.
