### Region of Interest (ROI) merging

The standard structure of region properties output by the MATLAB function regionprops (Area, BoundingBox, Centroid, etc.) are mimicked in a custom class called RegionOfInterest, where each field of the structure becomes a property of the custom class. We add additional properties for storing state information and data associated with each ROI, along with a number of methods for comparing, merging, manipulating, and visualizing the single-frame and multi-frame ROIs. The single-frame to multi-frame ROI merging procedure is essentially a clustering process that merges single-frame ROIs together using such criteria as the proximity of their centroids, as well as proximity of their bounding-box (upper-left and lower-right corners). Performing this operation quickly was highly dependent on pre-grouping ROIs based on centroid location in overlapping blocks of the image frame, as well as grouping by size. This enabled the clustering to be performed in parallel (across CPU cores) followed by a second iteration of clustering to deal with redundancy in overlapping regions.
