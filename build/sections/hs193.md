# Information and Informativity

This section presents a background in information theory in the context of behavior sensors and video streams. I further elaborate on what types of information neuroscientists and healthcare providers would hope to extract from these data, focusing on a larger picture of connecting the process of extraction directly the ultimate application.

Whereas previous attempts to process data focus largely on putting it in an intermediate state that is workable with current limitations on computation, visualization, and developer interaction with the data-streams, we now have an opportunity to skip intermediate states and develop with applications in mind.

Transition into compression by showing that previous attempts were essentially compression algorithms developed specifically for the data and preconceived notions about results, but that we can also apply very well developed general compression algorithms, with slight modifications to extract features such as localized bitrate that quantify (in an unbiased way) information content in an selectable region of a video-frame as it changes over time.
