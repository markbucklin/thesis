## Computer Software Environments for Image Processing

The widespread usage of MATLAB in neuroscience communities lends potential for greater usability and easier adaptation to software developed in this environment. While software development environments with a focus on "ease-of-use" have traditionally presumed crippling sacrifices to computational performance, this assumption is getting to be less accurate.

Standard programs include ImageJ, the built-in routines in MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox, Mosaic from Inscopix, which is merely a compiled version of MATLAB routines which uses the MATLAB engine, Sci-Kits Image for Python, and a remarkable diversity of other applications. MATLAB is a commercial software development platform which is geared toward fast production and prototyping of data processing routines in a high-level programming language. It implements several core libraries (LINPACK, BLAS, etc.) that make multithreaded operations on matrix type data highly efficient. While MATLAB has traditionally been a considered the standard across neuroscience research labs, it was also well recognized that its performance was lacking for routines that aren't "vectorized", when compared to applications developed using lower-level languages like FORTRAN, C, and C++. Nevertheless, it remained in common use, and recent releases have added features that can drastically mitigate its performance issues, particularly through the development of a "Just-In-Time" compiler that automatically optimizes the deployment of computation accelerator resources for standard MATLAB functions. This feature enables code that performs repeated operations using for-loops or while-loops nearly as fast as equivalent code written in C. Additionally, code can be compiled into executable format using the Matlab Compiler toolbox, or used to generate equivalent C or C++ code using Matlab Coder.
