### Systematic evaluation of potential DBS targets and mechanisms in PD mouse model:

To that end we are currently inducing a quantifiable PD-like state in mice with a unilateral injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the striatum, and subsequent administration of apomorphine to provoke side-biased motor deficits (Iancu et al. 2005) . Side-biased“turning” behavior is quantified autonomously on two distinct platforms, a computer-vision system that allows free movement, and a virtual-reality spherical treadmill platform that simulates free movement.
