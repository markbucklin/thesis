### Headplate

The bottom surface of the headplate is curved to conform to the dorsal
skull surface of a typical mouse. This feature aids alignment during
installation, and a large surface area enables a strong adhesive bond to
the skull surface. Adhesive cement is applied continuously along all
points of contact to create a permanent bond along the entire perimeter.
The cement applied along this joint effectively seals the bottom of the
aseptic chamber and is critical for its long-term integrity.

The wide area of skull-to-headplate attachment provides a mechanically
stable coupling between the animal's skull and the headplate holder,
which is fixed to the microscope table. The headplate is bonded to all
skull plates, which stiffens the skull tremendously. Additional rigidity
is provided by a central support structure that contacts the skull along
the sagittal suture. All these features combine to provide a very rigid
attachment to the mouse cranium, which drastically reduces its motion
relative to the imaging system (Fig 1b). Remaining brain motion is then
primarily movement relative to the skull, and may originate from
physiological forces (i.e. cardiorespiratory) as much as behavioral
forces from animal movement; suppressing this intracranial motion is
addressed in the design of the silicone window insert described below.
