## Injection

The exposed brain was flushed with sterile saline before and after each
injection. Injections were made using pulled glass micropipettes with
inner tip diameter ranging from 40 and 80 um (WPI, 504949). The
micropipette was initially back-filled with mineral oil, then secured
onto a microprocessor controlled injector (WPI, NANOLITER2010). The
micropipette was then front-loaded with virus or cells using a
controller (WPI, Sys-Micro4). In general, an injection of 230 nL of
cells labeled with AAV9.CAG.GCaMP6f (AV-9-PV3081, Penn Vector Core) at
10^6^ cells/uL, or 230 nL of AAV9.Syn.GCaMP6f (AV-9-PV2822, Penn Vector
Core). Injection was performed approximately 500 um deep into the cortex
at the rate of 46 nL/min near the center of the imaging field, while
avoiding blood vessels to maximize the observable cells around the
injection site (Fig. 2 Step 3). The micropipette was left to sit for an
additional 2 min at the injection site before slow withdrawal.
