### Chamber

The chamber in the headplate center facilitates physical access to
neural tissue by protecting the craniotomy sites between interventions.
Once the headplate is bonded to the animal's skull, the floor of the
chamber is formed by the central support structure that traverses and
fuses the sagittal suture, the skull surface surrounding each
craniotomy, and a flat ledge that extends laterally. The joints between
the skull surface edges of the central support, anterior and posterior
walls, and the lateral ledge are sealed during the headplate attachment
procedure. This bottom seal is crucial for maintaining an aseptic
environment for the protection of the exposed brain tissue. When the
dura mater is left intact during the craniotomy, the space within the
chamber is continuous with the epidural space.
