#### Signal Filtering, LFP and MUA

Electrophysiology data would be digitally filtered on the Intan chip using parameters selected by the machine-learning routine. The only hard limits on bandwidth would be dictated by the requirements of the analog to digital converter (ADC), i.e. a high-pass filter to remove drifting DC offsets and a low-pass filter to prevent aliasing. These limits would vary depending on electrode impedance and sampling frequency, but would have cutoff frequencies or roughly 0.1 Hz and 10 KHz respectively. While there is much published in regard to the spatial extent and information content in common named frequency bands, the algorithm that selects filtering parameters would not incorporate any of these assumptions.

That being said, we expect the learning algorithm would find more _reliably relevant_ features in the classic Local Field Potential (LFP) range, which is typically low-pass filtered with a cut-off around 300 Hz. It’s thought that LFP represents a sum of neural activity from cells within a 50-250 micron radius of the electrode tip, or more if activity is highly correlated (Lindén et al. 2011). This spatial scale allows for variability in electrode position across subjects, and for small movements of the electrode over time (Andersen, Musallam, and Pesaran 2004).
