### Region of Interest (ROI) identification & segmentation

The ROI detection process used an adaptive threshold on the z-score of pixel intensity to reduce each frame to binary 1's and 0's (logical true or false). These binary frames were then processed using morphological operations to find and label connected components within each frame. For example, beginning with a z-score threshold of 1.5, all pixels that were more than 1.5 standard deviations above their mean were reduced to 1 (true), and all others reduced to 0 (false). Pixels reduced to 1 were often pixels overlying a cell that was significantly brighter during that frame due to activation of GCaMP. This initial threshold was adjusted up or down based on the number of non-zero pixels detected with each threshold. This was done to prevent spurious motion-induced shifts of the image frame from producing ROIs along high contrast borders. All morphological operations were performed using built-in MATLAB functions from the Image Processing Toolbox, which have fast parallel versions if the operation is run on a graphics card (e.g. imclose, imopen, etc.). Furthermore, the connected-component labeling and region formation operations were run using built-in MATLAB functions bwconncomp, and regionprops. Connected components were stored in a custom class and termed "single-frame ROIs," and these were then passed to the 3rd stage of processing, which merges them into a "multi-frame ROI" that represents the location and spatial distribution of each cell identified over the entire video.
