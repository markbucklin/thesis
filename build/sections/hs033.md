#### Shortcomings

Any device that relies on optogenetics to deliver stimulation to neurons inherently shares the same hurdles to clinical translation, the requirement for gene-therapy and its associated risks. Several early trials of viral transfection of cells had adverse effects including a greatly increased risk of carcinoma. In these early studies, the DNA insertion location was uncontrolled leaving important regions of DNA tumor suppressor genes exposed to damage. New methods that improve the safety of gene therapy have been developed. Several of the more recent methods utilize adeno-associated virus  (AAV) and show greater control regarding DNA insertion and decreased DNA damage. These more recent methods suggest a possibility that with continuing research, such a method may be developed without the potential for malignancy.

Working on a project that requires a technology that does not as of yet exist, represents one of the greatest educational benefits of this project. That leap of faith into a future that does not exist requires us to depend on each other as a team of collaborators, as each of our work depends on the othersâ€™ success. In order to succeed, we must do so together; and without eachother, our therapeutics would never reach their ultimate goal, the patient. As such, we would share each success and setback in the same way whether such events occur within our own labs or labs across the country.
