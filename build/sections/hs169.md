## Figure 2 Flexible experimental timeline for surgery, injection and imaging.

Two-part assembly allows flexible timeline to separate the procedure of
headplate installation and craniotomy from injection which helps with
optical clarity during the early period imaging. On Day -2 which can
extend upto Day -7, headplate installation and craniotomy is performed.
Step 1 shows the placement of the headplate above the intended
craniotomy region (before) and the fixation to the skull using opaque
Metabond (after). After at least 48 hours of recovery period, injection
and window installation is performed on Day 0. Step 3 shows injection
using a micropipette filled with Evans Blue dye for demonstration only.
Step 4 shows window installed above headplate using dental cement. Any
cavity between the two pieces are filled with sterile 0.5% agarose.
Lastly, imaging session can start from Day 4. Step 5 shows a mouse
freely running on a treadmill during a imaging session while its head
movement is restrained. The microscope is installed above the animal.
Step 6 shows after window removal (before) that allows full tissue
access, and a new window installed (after) that allows continuation of
imaging over the same region.
