## Methods and Approach

Image processing is performed offline using MATLAB software. The goal of this procedure is to reduce the raw image sequence to a collection of one-dimensional traces, where each trace indicates the fluorescence intensity of an individual neuron over time, and the collection approximates the distinct activity of each and every neuron in the microscope's field of view. We implement the process in 3 distinct stages as described below. The main novel contribution of this work is the efficient extension of segmented ROIs into the third dimension by clustering features of ROIs segmented separately in two dimensions. Online processing uses a similar approach, and the differences are explained in the next section.
