## Method and Approach

The entire procedure for processing images and extracting cell signals can be performed in substantially less time than most commonly available tools using the approach described in Aim 1, particularly the methods for restricting the spatial extent of pixel-association operations, and distributing operations across parallel processing cores using a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) archetype. However, the total time still exceeds that of the acquisition session. Inefficiency arises from the overhead involved with distributing data and passing information between separate parallel processes. Graphics cards, however execute in what's called Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) fashion, to distribute computation across the thousands of processing cores.

The processing components are implemented using the MATLAB System-Object framework, which allows for slightly faster performance through internal optimizations having to do with memory allocation. Most system objects, each representing one step in the serial processing and signal-extraction procedure, also have companion functions that implement the computation-heavy components of each algorithm using a pre-compiled CUDA kernel.
