#### Systematically evaluate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying DBS therapeutic effect on PD {#sec:f31-aim3}

Even though the precise therapeutic mechanism of DBS is unclear, DBS has revealed tremendous information about the brainâ€™s functionings and dysfunctionings. For example, pathological beta oscillations, oscillations around 20Hz, have been widely observed in the cortical-basal gangion circuits in PD patients implanted with DBS electrodes. As the causal role of beta oscillations is yet to be established, it is likely that the neural network states identified in Aim 2 would conform and converge into distinct archetypes, such as beta oscillations within the cortical-basal gangion circuits relevant to PD. I hypothesize that neuromodulation outside of the classical PD neural circuit would be therapeutic, in so far as such neuromodulation is capable of scrambling pathological network dynamics. Once proven correct, the proposed therapeutic mechanisms of DBS through altering neural network pathological representationswould provide a basis for a new generation of neural circuit based neuromodulation therapies.
