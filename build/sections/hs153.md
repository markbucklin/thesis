### Experimental Batches

The first batch served as a short trial-run for the prototype and
procedures whose performance in early tests suggested strong potential
for long-term reliability. We ran the first batch for 4-6 weeks to get a
better assessment of what we could expect for long-term viability. With
this design and minor modifications to the surgical procedure, we felt
comfortable using the window in studies with long-term requirements that
would also allow for continuous assessment of the window's performance
in parallel. The first batch of windows was installed in April-May 2017
(N = 7) and was evaluated 2-3 times/week for just over 1 month. Several
more were implanted for use in a long-term imaging study beginning with
a second batch in June 2 017 (N = 6), and a third in October 2017 (N =
5). The results of these runs are reported below, summarized in figure
3-b.
