### Non-Stationarity & Differential Moments

Stationary refers to the property of a signal such that its statistics do not vary over time, i.e. its distribution is stable. Neural signals tend to specifically *not* have this property, in contrast to other measurable components such as those contributed by physiologic noise (heart-rate, respirations, etc.). Thus, by analyzing the evolution of statistical measures calculated for each pixel as frames are added in sequence gives a highly sensitive indicator of neural activity. This is done using a routine analogous to that for updating central moments given above, except the values returned are not only the updated moment, but also the updating component -- essentially the partial derivative with respect to time. This is illustrated below, including the normalization functions which convert the partial-moment values to their variance, skewness, and kurtosis analogues:

> % COMPUTE DIFFERENTIAL UPDATE TO CENTRAL MOMENTS
>
> dm1 = dk;
>
> m1 = m1 + dm1;
>
> dm4 = s\*dk2\*(n\^2-3\*n+3) + 6\*dk2\*m2 - 4\*dk\*m3;
>
> dm3 = s\*dk\*(n-2) - 3\*dk\*m2;
>
> dm2 = s;
>
> m2 = m2 + dm2;
>
> % NORMALIZE BY VARIANCE & SAMPLE NUMBER -&gt; CONVERSION TO dVar, dSkew, dKurt
>
> dm2 = dm2/max(1,n-1);
>
> dm3 = dm3\*sqrt(max(1,n))/(m2\^1.5);
>
> dm4 = dm4\*n/(m2\^2);

These functions run on images representing the image intensity, and also on images taken from sequential differences indicating the temporal derivative of image intensity. The combination of outputs from these operations indicate both when image intensities are significantly high relative to past distribution, and also when intensities are changing significantly faster than learned from their past distribution.
