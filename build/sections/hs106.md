### Predicting Activation State & Assessing Network Activity

The continuous signal intensity signals can be reduced to binary indicators of activity for each frame. This enables simplified and fast calculation of information theory measures, such as activation probability, joint and conditional probabilities, response entropy, mutual information, etc. The conversion from continuous to binary uses several abstractions of the signal applied to a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The abstractions are calculated from the following:

1.  Linear least-squares fits to moving windows with variable size to find slope of the line surrounding each point.

2.  Skewness and Kurtosis of finite windows surrounding each data point.

3.  Temporal difference of fluorescence intensity.

The gaussian mixture model employs all measures to infer periods of reliable distinct activation of neurons.
