### Buffered Operations

Combining frames for each operation can result in near linear speedup. For example, for the phase-correlation step required for motion correction, the FFT and IFFT are called on 16 image-frames at once, and the time take to accomplish is approximately the same as if the operation were called on 1 frame. This essentially leads to a 16x speedup, though the latency is also increased slightly. The best size to use is difficult to pre-determine, and typically must be measured for varying size 'chunks' using the benchmarking functions indicated above. The system objects manage the details necessary to allow buffered chunks of video to be passed to each stage without introducing artifacts at the temporal edges between chunks.
