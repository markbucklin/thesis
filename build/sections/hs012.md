### FrameSynx Toolbox {#sec:framesynx-toolbox}

The FrameSynx toolbox for MATLAB was built to synchronize continuous image acquisition with experiments conducted in the neuroscience laboratory setting. While the experiments are conducted in separate software (and potentially on a different computer), FrameSynx listens for messages to start/stop the experiment, start a trial, etc. and responds accordingly by controlling one or multiple cameras and illumination devices, and synchronizing this information with the data acquired. The major contribution to the "Behavior Box" package, and also to later image processing packages is the procedure for definition and storage and of experimental data files, which will be touched on briefly in [@sec:data-file]
