#### Machine-Learning & Optimization

The process for selecting exactly how to stimulate a brain follows a common routine both in the clinic and research laboratory. After having spatially localized an electrode in the intended position, physicians (and neuroscientists) would begin stimulation with a temporal pattern that is fully defined with two or three parameters (e.g. a binary pulse-sequence with constant amplitude, frequency, and duty-cycle). Effects of stimulation are often immediately apparent. The physician or neuroscientist – let’s just call this person the “_decision-maker_” – would evaluate the subjects behavior and compare this evaluation to the desired _target_ behavior. In the example case of PD the deviations from this “target behavior” include akinesia, gait-inbalances, and postural instability, but might also include iatrogenic responses such as dyskinesias or diplopia. The decision-maker then draws on their experience to estimate which parameters should be adjusted, and with what magnitude in order to shift behavior towards the intended target. In the absence of experience, the decision-maker relies on _education_ (many years of it in either the physician or scientist’s case). The first adjustment is applied, and the effect on behavior is evaluated once again. The inexperienced decision-maker learns something new, and can use this new information in combination (or perhaps even _in contrast!)_ with their prior education to estimate the effect of adjustments in any or all available parameters, and make a decision that begins the cycle again.

Humans are excellent learners – undoubtedly better than any other species on Earth. Computers are not; they are painfully literal and would not flip a bit without being told to. Their persistence, however, is their saving grace, and is the aspect that makes machine learning possible, given creatively designed seeds of human thought and recursive and inversive instructions for expanding this seed. The process of cyclic evaluation and decision-making described above would be used as a model for a machine-learning algorithm with two goals: optimizing the identification of _disease-relevant neural states_, and optimizing a neuromodulation routine for _disease-related symptom reduction_.
