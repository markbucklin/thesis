## Figure 1 Design, assembly and installation of the polymeric optical window.

\(a) Schematic of the window system assembled and installed to the
animal. Cross section shows the placement of the window as the bottom
plane contacts the brain as it extends below the surface of the skull.
Side view shows the adjustable height between the window and the
headplate to compensate the cavity from skull removal. (b) Top and side
view of the polymer window and the headplate. The window frame and the
headplate are made of aluminum, and the window is molded in PDMS.
Exploded view shows how the two pieces can be assembled. Front side of
the headplate includes a feature that avoids hitting the eyes of the
animal. (c) Top and (d) side view of the parts. (f) Parts assembled and
installed to the animal.
