Recording would be accomplished with the RHD2132 digital electrophysiology interface chip produced and made freely available by Intan (“RHD2000 Amplifier Chips | Intan Technologies” 2013). The chip accomplishes as much as a traditional electrophysiology system at a price that is orders of magnitude less, and a package that takes up much less space.
