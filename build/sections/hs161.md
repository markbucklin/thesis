## Window casting procedure

The PDMS-based windows were fabricated through vacuum casting procedure.
Prior to casting, window frames and two glass coverslips (Corning,
2947-75x38), prepared in advance through plasma etching (30 sec, Power
setting) and silanization using Trichlorosilane (Sigma-Aldrich,
448931-10G), were inserted into the mold. The mold was then placed
between two custom-made acrylic plates with silicone gaskets in between
and was assembled using bolts around the perimeter. The pressure control
port (McMaster-Carr, 5454K61) was connected to the house vacuum line,
and the fill port (McMaster-Carr, 2844K11) was connected to uncured PDMS
polymer (Dow Corning Sylgard 184) (1:10 by weight), thoroughly mixed and
degassed in advance. The liquid-state polymer was then drawn into the
mold filling the volume in between the two coverslips using vacuum. Once
polymer displaced all air, vacuum was released and positive pressure was
applied through the pressure control port after plugging the fill port.
While maintaining positive pressure, the polymer was cured at 75ÂºC for
12 hours. Finally, the windows were released from the mold and trimmed
using scalpels. Windows were handled so as to protect the top and bottom
surfaces from damage or debris. The completed window was sterilized in
an autoclave before use.
