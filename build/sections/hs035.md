#### Neural Interface

A _chronic neural implant_ is required for this project, as the machine-learning component of this closed-loop system would require time and signal stability to function effectively. While our lab currently employs chronically implanted drivable tetrode arrays, this project would benefit from dropping this complexity in favor of _static_ electrodes that are set to their prescribed position during the initial surgery, and never thereafter.


Sustained penetration of brain tissue with large  (15 microns) diameter electrodes provokes a chonic inflammatory reaction to the foreign body eventually encapsulates the electrode in a “glial scar” and inhibits regeneration of neural process in the vicinity  (@polikov_response_2005). The chronic implant designed for this project would use silicon electrodes to record from deep brain targets, and for shallow targets would employ _carbon fiber electrodes_  (4-10 microns) using methods developed in a nearby collaborating lab  (@guitchounts_carbon-fiber_2013). Carbon fiber is cheaply available with a range of electrical properties, but the common properties of high modulus and small diameter – 5-10 micron vs. 30-50 microns for typical commercial microwire arrays  (@ward_toward_2009) – allows carbon fiber to penetrate brain tissue without deforming, and to remain long-term without provoking an inflammatory reaction  (@kozai_ultrasmall_2012).
