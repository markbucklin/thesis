#### Stimulus Sequence Generation

Each neural state would be mapped to a neuromodulation routine that is applied continuously (with _sub-millisecond_ response time) until the next state-estimate and routine update. Each stimulation sequence would initially be defined by random selection from a set of sequence _archetypes_, and further specification by random selection of _archetype-specific-parameters_. The real-time process would handle application of the state-mapped sequence, but the sequence formation routines would be run in the non-real-time process. Both open-loop (for control/comparison) and closed-loop stimulation archetypes would be generated from three sources, with generic examples from each source in the table below:

1.  Common achetypes reported in literature, e.g. DBS-style constant pulse generation.

2.  Novel archetypes generated in creative thinking and discussion sessions with colleagues.

3.  Concocted archetypes from chaotic-generation algorithm

_Constant DBS-type square wave_ with parameters for amplitude, frequency, and pulse-width/duty-cycle (open-loop) LED power (stimulation) in each area of control proportional to _arctangent of phase difference_ between two areas. Chaotically generate functions by recombining elements from the novel and common archetypes, and also by applying every function available in MATLAB (use _what_ and _lookfor_ functions applied in _try…catch…_ blocks to find statements that work with given data) _Triggered impulse response_ with parameters defining a threshold or feature from any channel that triggers stimulation of some shape that initiates at some delay (Rosin et al. 2011) (closed-loop) Stimulation is continuously proportional a _ratio of band-pass filtered signal magnitude_ from arbitrarily selected channels.\
_Phase Cancellation_ of filtered signal from any defined channel (Brittain et al. 2013) (closed-loop) Signal from one channel is used to construct _wavelet_ then convolved with other channels with output determining pulse-shape

The number of possible archetypes used by sourcing in these ways would be extensive, so much so that trying them manually would be unmanageable. This is where the automated machine-learning algorithm which selects, applies, evaluates, and optimizes each routine for several hours every day becomes absolutely necessary.
