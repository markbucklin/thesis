## Device development and fabrication

Components were designed using SolidWorks. Prototypes were fabricated
using CamBam to generate toolpaths in G-code for machining on a CNC
mill. The headplate and window frame were milled from aluminum plate.
The mold for casting PDMS-based windows was designed in three parts. The
middle component was milled from PTFE. The outer components were made
using a laser-cutter and acrylic sheet (Supplementary). CAD files are
shared on XXXXX(github?)XXXXX.
