### Parallel Processing

Many built-in MATLAB functions are implemented using efficient multi-threaded procedures, and these are used to the extent that they can be. However, for procedures that must operate on data in irregular formats (i.e. any format other than N-dimensional arrays of primitive data types), one also has the option of performing explicitly defined parallel operations by distributing data across multiple parallel processes, each with their own memory space. Below I give examples of how implementing in a multi-threaded fashion can substantially boost performance, and also an example of a situation where multi-threaded operations aren't possible without explicit calls for parallel distribution.

Standard elementwise operators like _plus_ (+) and _times_ (.\*), as well as comparison operators like _equals_ (==) and _less-than_ (&lt;) will be performed efficiently using as many processing cores as available when applied to large n-dimensional arrays of the same size. However, when operand sizes differ a simple call to the built-in operation will not work. For example, if we wish to subtract the average from each pixel over time from all frames in the series we can accomplish this with a call to MATLAB's _bsxfun_ function, which stands for Binary-Singleton-eXpansion-FUNction, as shown below:

```matlab

      Fmeansub = bsxfun( @minus, F, mean(F,3) );

```

This operation passes a function handle as the first argument (denoted by the '@' symbol) indicating the operation to perform. It then passes the entire \[IxJxK\] array of image data as the second argument, and it's temporal mean with size \[IxJx1\] is calculated once and passed as the third. The function efficiently expands the mean argument as needed for fast distribution across parallel threads.
