#### Justification for This Approach

The novel closed-loop neuromodulation system as presented here has far reaching implications. These include improved patient symptoms, fewer surgical procedures  ( for battery replacement) and broader application in terms of patient population and disease profiles. The increase in number and range of stimulation sites and rapid real-time response rate of the proposed mechanism would yield such results  (Lozano and Lipsman 2013). Furthermore, the information on DBS mechanism gleamed from this study would have immediate effects on the current technology
