### Background

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been used clinically since the early 1990’s, and is currently approved by the FDA for treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and essential tremor, with Humanitarian Device Exemptions for OCD and dystonia. In 1987 a French neurosurgeon observed during a thalamotomy procedure - where stimulation was applied for localization of ventralis intermedius - that high-frequency stimulation was able to suppress an extrapyramidal tremor (@benabid_combined_1987; @liker_deep_2008). Subsequent studies in a non-human primate Parkinson’s model suggested high-frequency stimulation (\~100-200 Hz) of the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) was as effective as a lesion, in that it“jammed” neural activity at the tip of the electrode, yet it was tunable and reversible (@eusebio_does_2012). Long term efficacy is around 50% using a standard clinical scale (UPDRS III)(@beuter_delayed_2009); DBS can provide symptomatic improvement in tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, and can also facilitate a substantial reduction in levodopa dosage and consequent reduction in its major side-effects, i.e. dyskinesia (@eusebio_does_2012). While DBS has substantially improved our ability to treat PD and other movement disorders, the therapeutic effect remains insufficient and unpredictable.

The mechanism by which DBS suppresses parkinsonian symptoms is still uncertain. However, there are growing evidence to suggest that increases in synchronized oscillatory activity in basal ganglia and thalamo-cortical circuits – so-called _Beta-frequency_ oscillations – represents a pathologic and moreover _symptomatic_ state in PD, the disruption of which is accomplished by high-frequency stimulation (@wilson_chaotic_2011). Meanwhile, synchronized activity in the beta range is also involved in many normal cognitive functions, and abnormal synchronization is likewise a mechanism for numerous other neurologic and psychiatric disorders (@velazquez_biophysical_2012),(@andrews_neuromodulation_2010). Consequently DBS has potential to become an effective treatment for epilepsy (@ii_dynamic_2013),  OCD(@bourne_mechanisms_2012), depression ( @mayberg_deep_2005, @mayberg_targeted_2009), Alien Hand Syndrome and Tourette’s  (@krack_deep_2010), obesity  (@taghva_obesity_2012), alcoholism  (@heldmann_deep_2012), addiction (@luigjes_deep_2012), autism  (@sturm_dbs_2013), Alzheimer’s disease  (@laxton_deep_nodate), and schizophrenia (@white_dysregulated_2013). There are a large number of case-reports describing off-label DBS treatments, and a few small clinical trials  (@kennedy_deep_2011-1; @sarem-aslani_industrial_2011). In 2009 Medtronic received a Humanitarian Device Exemption  (HDE) to market a DBS device for OCD, called _Reclaim_ (“Reclaim^TM^ Deep Brain Stimulation for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder  (OCD) Therapy - H050003”2013). While closed-loop DBS might be even better suited for the complex dynamics of psychiatric disorders, most investigators have stuck with movement and seizure disorders  (@sarem-aslani_industrial_2011), presumably feeling more comfortable with well-established animal models and FDA-approved applications; or perhaps feeling _less_ comfortable with the ethical questions inherent to treating of behavior.
