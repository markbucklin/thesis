### Image Pre-processing: Contrast Enhancement and Motion Correction

Alignment of each frame in the image sequence with all other frames is essential to the methods we use in subsequent steps for identifying and tracking cells over time. Thus, the goal of the first stage is to correct for any misalignment caused by movement of the brain relative to the microscope and camera.

Many algorithms for estimating and correcting image displacement exist and are well described in the medical imaging literature. We elected to use phase-correlation to estimate the induced motion in each frame, as we found this method to be highly stable, moderately accurate, and (most importantly) fast, especially when implemented in the frequency domain and using a decent graphics card.

Phase-correlation estimates the mean translational displacement between two frames, one being the template or "fixed" frame, and the other being the uncorrected or "moving" frame. In the spatial domain this is accomplished by computing the normalized cross-correlation, which implies a 2-dimensional convolution of large matrices. The equivalent operation in the frequency domain is a simple scalar dot-product of the discrete Fourier transforms of each image normalized by the square of the template, followed by the inverse Fourier transform. The intermediate result is the cross-correlation (or phase-correlation) matrix, which should have a peak in its center for correctly aligned images, or a peak near the center, the offset of which indicates the mean offset between the two images. This peak can be found with subpixel precision by interpolation to give a more accurate alignment, although at some moderate expense in computation time.

For the template image we used a moving average of previously aligned frames when processing frames sequentially, or alternatively a fixed mean of randomly sampled and sequentially aligned images from the entire set when processing files in parallel. The simplest way to perform this operation is to use the built-in MATLAB function normxcorr2, which makes optimization decisions based on image size and available hardware automatically. However, performance can be improved by tailoring the operation to your particular hardware and image size, i.e. using fft2 and ifft2 for large images and a good graphics card.
