## Behavior Box {#sec:behavior-box}

I built an experiment apparatus for mice to enable a study being run by Jia-Min Zhuo. The goal of the study wasto elucidate the role of adult-born neurons on mouse behavior, specifically their performance in discrimination tasks. We called the apparatus the "Behavior Box" and modeled it after a commercially available but grossly over-priced box that itself came from other labs [@clelland2009, @creer2010].

The chamber was constructed with black plastic walls, extruded aluminum framing, and a perforated metal mesh floor 1 cm above a plastic waste tray. A 10-inch infrared touchscreen (ITouch Systems) was mounted over a 10-inch LCD monitor forming one wall of the chamber. An opaque mask with seven windows was placed over the screeen to limit where the mouse could touch. A water pump with infrared detector was located at teh other end of the chamber to provide reward for the water-deprived mice in the study. A white LED strip encircled the chamber from the top, and multiple speakers positioned outside to deliver sound cues. A web camera was fixed above the chamber to record and monitor mouse activity. My contribution to this project was the program for interact with all the system components. This program controlled and recorded experiment progress. I developed the program in MATLAB, and the main components of its function are described below.
