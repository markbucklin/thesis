#### Electrophysiology

The neural interface proposed in this document would record 32 signals simultaneously. To minimize the risk that poor trajectory planning could have on the results described in [@sec:f31-aim3], we would specify targets redundantly. Thus, for each round of testing with our Parkinson’s mouse model we would select 8 brain areas to record from redundantly and bilaterally. 7 of the 8 would be selected from a set of brain areas for which claims have been made in the literature suggesting functional relevance to Parkinson’s disease; as a _control_ for each round, the 8^th^ would be selected from a set of areas for which no connection with PD has ever been reported. Each round would begin with a modified CAD model of the implant (for modified electrode trajectories), which would be 3D printed or fabricated on a 4-axis CNC-mill in the lab.
