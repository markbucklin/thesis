## Evaluation of System Performance

Throughout development we implanted several prototypes to test the
effect of various features and conditions. The cranial window design and
surgical procedures described in this paper were attempted with 18 mice.
Cranial window condition was evaluated by direct observation and
evaluation of fluorescence dynamics in processed video recorded during
periodic 5-minute imaging sessions. Direct (bright-field) observation
with a stereoscopic microscope was useful for evaluating quality of the
optical interface with brain tissue, as well as for tracking progression
of granulation tissue growth in the surrounding space at the edges of
the craniotomy. Analysis of cell dynamics measures from processed
fluorescence imaging video indicated actual usability of the window for
longitudinal studies requiring activity metrics at a cellular level.
