### Image Pre-Processing & Motion Correction

Pre-processing is implemented as with the offline procedure, with a few changes. Images are aligned in chunks, and they are aligned sequentially to two templates. One template is the most recent stable frame from the preceding chunk. The other is a recursively temporal-low-pass filtered image that mitigates slow drifts. Aligning to the first template is usually more stable as the brightness of cells in the recent image will be more similar to those in the current chunk than will be the brightness of cells in the slow-moving average.

The displacement of each frame is found to sub-pixel precision, then used with a custom bicubic resampling kernel that replaces any pixels at the edges with images from the moving average.
