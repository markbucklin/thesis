### Significance

This proposal focuses on developing a novel closed-loop neuromodulation system using optogenetics and an intelligent control algorithm. This approach enables automation of a search for individual-optimized stimulation patterns, and adaptation of these patterns over time in response to fluctuating symptoms.
