#### Design a novel adaptive neuromodulation platform for closed loop control of neural activities {#sec:f31-aim1}

Functional neural systems underlying brain disorders are likely complex, impacting interconnected brain areas. To reliably distinguish normal and pathologic neural network states, such as the “on/off” states in PD, it would be advantageous to simultaneously measure neural activities in multiple relevant brain areas. The platform proposed here consists of a bidirectional neural interface with penetrating silicon electrodes capable of simultaneously recording from multiple sites interspersed with LED-coupled optical-fibers for multi-point optogenetic neuromodulation. I would use the commercially available multicontact silicon electrodes, known as Michigan probes, that are 5um thick and capable of recording up to hundreds of locations simultaneously. To perform neuromodulation with high spatiotemporal precision, I would use optogenetic methods to activate or silence specific neurons expressing rhodopsins in mice using certain colors of light. Even though this system is designed for mice in this study, the principles demonstrated here have a clear translational path to humans.
