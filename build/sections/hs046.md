#### Stimulus Optimization

As the real-time component runs its state-response cycle and logs data, the non-real-time machine-learning component would evaluate its performance and update parameters in an attempt to optimize _symptom suppression_. This evaluation process would identify “hot” parameters (those with large effect), and continue sending parameter updates until symptom suppression cannot be optimized further. This process would be slow to allow observation of subtle effects of stimulation in noisy data. If manipulation of all available parameters yields no changes in behavior, a new stimulation archetype would be tried.

This type of process is sometimes referred to as a _Genetic_ _Algorithm_, where the parameters for a particular archetype would be viewed as the _genes_ that define a species. The _fitness_ of each individual combination genes (i.e. parameters) determines survival and consequent ability to pass genes to the next generation. In our implementation, we’d be running multiple species (i.e. archetypes) as well, with the expectation that many would be quickly declared extinct.
