### Signal Extraction from Subcellular Compartments

I also have functions for the extraction of normalized Pointwise-Mutual-Information (nPMI), which can operate on a pixel-to-pixel basis or on a region-to-pixel basis. This operation accumulates mutually informative changes in all pixels in the maximal bounding-box (e.g. 64x64 pixels) surrounding each identified regions centroid. The weights given by this function can take on values between -1 and 1, and can be used to inform any reduction operations to follow. Additionally, spatial moments can indicate the subcellular distribution of activity across the identified region. In this context, the first spatial moment M~00~ indicates the mean signal intensity.
