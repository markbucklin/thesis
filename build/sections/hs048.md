#### Metrics of Behavior

Two testing platforms would be used to assess changes in behavior over time. Behavior is analyzed and quantified in real-time, and would be synchronized with electrophysiology and made available as another stream of input for the closed-loop routine. The quantification routine creates a signal that is representative of symptom severity. For our unilaterally lesioned mouse model of PD the most readily observable impairment is the inability to walk straight; mice would turn in circles contralateral to the lesion when given intraperitoneal apomorphine. The behavioral apparati are described below.
