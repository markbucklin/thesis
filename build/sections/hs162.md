## Surgical procedures

Animal care for surgical procedures is described below, and the details
specific to each procedure are in the sections that follow. All
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use at
Boston University. Stereotaxic surgeries were performed on 6 to 8 weeks
old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories). Pre-operative care
for the initial headplate and craniotomy procedure included subcutaneous
administration of meloxicam (NSAID, 2.5 ug/g) and buprenorphine (opioid
analgesics, 0.3 ug/g), and intramuscular injection of dexamethasone
(corticosteroid, 5 ug/g) one hour before surgery. Meloxicam and
buprenorphine were continued postoperatively every 12 hours for 48
hours. Meloxicam was also given before and after procedures where brain
tissue was exposed, i.e. those for intracerebral injection and window
replacement. For all procedures described below, mice were placed under
general anesthesia with isoflurane mixed with oxygen.
