## Cranial Window **[System]{.smallcaps}**

Many design features, and procedures for implantation were introduced
and developed to mitigate tissue growth for the sustained optical
quality of the window. Other features were included to enhance imaging
performance in awake behaving animals, to facilitate repeatable
localization of image fields across sessions and animal subjects.

The cranial implant system is composed of two parts: a headplate with an
integrated chamber, and a silicone optical insert. The headplate is
bonded to the dorsal surface of the animal's bare skull. The optical
insert -- sometimes referred to as a "cranial window" -- seals the
chamber and establishes an optical interface with the animal's brain
through craniotomy sites in the chamber floor (Fig 1a).
