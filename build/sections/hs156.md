### In vivo Tracking of Transplanted Stem Cells over Long Term

The ability to separate the installation procedure into Stage 1 and 2
was critical to capture the integration process of transplanted stem
cells from day 4 and day 563 (figure 4). In addition to window
installation, the experiment entails dissection of progenitor cells from
E13.5 mouse embryos prior to transplantation which sequences require to
be carried out in a timely manner. Tailored to this specific
application, we performed Stage 1 of the installation procedure two days
in advance, allowing time for tissue dissection immediately before
conducting Stage 2 on day 0 (figure 4-b).

Figure 4-a shows one of the exceptional mice transplanted with two
distinct cellular sources of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in left
and right hemispheres, respectively. The optical interface of the
cranial window sustained to
