### Online Cell Segmentation & Tracking

Cells are segmented by first running sequential statistics on the properties of identifiable regions on a pixel-wise basis. That is, as regions are identified in a method similar to that used offline in Aim 1, the region-properties are calculated (Centroid, Bounding-Box, etc.) and statistics for these properties are updated at each pixel covered by a proposed region. After sufficient evidence has gathered, Seeds are generated by finding the local peak of a seed-probability function that optimizes each pixel's proximity to a region centroid, and distance from any boundary. Regions are grown from these seed regions, and registered in a hierarchy that allows for co-labeling of cellular and sub-cellular components. Newly identified regions occur as new seeds, where as seeds overlapping with old regions are used to identify sub-regions, or to track regions over time.
