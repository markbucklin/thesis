#### Implement a library of closed loop modulation protocols with machine-learning algorithms {#sec:f31-aim2}

To efficiently determine the neural network states responsible for a specific disease condition, I would use machine-learning algorithms to implement a library of optimized strategies. Specifically, this system consists of two parts: The first is a closed-loop control system responsible for gathering and analyzing streams of neural and behavioral data in real-time to estimate a neurobehavioral state, and then applying a state-specific optogenetic control with patterned light into the brain. The second component is a slower and more complex routine that records and analyzes the streams of neural and behavioral data, and assesses the performance of state-estimates and controls applied by the real-time component. State-response strategy updates would be periodically fed from the thoughtful controller  (2^nd^ component) to the real-time decision maker  (1^st^ component) using variations of traditional machine-learning algorithms to generate successively optimized strategies.
