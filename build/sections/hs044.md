#### Identification of Neural State

The algorithm used to optimize closed-loop identification of neural neural state would be developed from a set of common _pattern-recognition_ algorithms and _semi-supervised learning_ models, including support vector machines (SVMs), logistic, polynomial, or linear regression, principal component regression (PCR), Kalman filtering, and hidden Markov models (HMM). These algorithms would be applied to recorded data and _selected for implementation_ in the closed-loop routine based on measures of performance (discussed below) and ability to meet computation-time specifications (&lt;\~250 ms).
