## Closed-Loop Diffuse Optogenetic Neuromodulation

<!-- carbon fiber electrode & LED -->
<!-- (Deep-Target Carbon-Fiber Electrode Array and Bilateral Illumination) -->

Chronic implant for long-term multi-site recording and optogenetic neuromodulation. The implant is fixed to a mouseâ€™s skull with dental cement, and sits on top of bilateral 5 mm craniotomies. Electrodes are driven through 32 guiding-tunnels along pre-determined trajectories to bilateral targets in thalamus, striatum, prefrontal cortex, motor cortex and auditory cortex. 2 High-intensity LEDs are coupled to optical fibers driven to mediodorsal and centromedial thalamic nuclei. Electrode trajectories are computed in stereotaxic coordinates and imported into CAD model to construct guiding-tunnel features that facilitate correct placement of electrode tips in brain targets and connection to a circuit board. A-C) CAD model of implant. D) Circuit board for electrode termination and LED power.

Brain disease, often accompanied by enormous personal and economic costs, continues to emerge as among the most pressing contributors to the global disease burden. Unprecedented advances in biotechnology and in portable electronics support tremendous opportunity to conduct research with excellent potential for advanced understanding, improved treatments, and one day cures for these devastating diseases, disorders and conditions. The aim of this project was to would leverage technology from the fast-moving forefronts of electronics and biomedical research to build a next-generation neuroprosthetic.
