## Adaptability

##

-   we then explored the ability of the cranial implant system to be
    adapted to provide greater utility

-   building upon the original configuration, we adapted the system to
    accommodate an enlarged window, proving both complete coverage of
    dorsal cortex and similar overall functionality of the original
    system

-   while much of the functional performance of the original system were
    realized by its physical structures, we customized existing features
    to meet the new design requirements and constraints for proper
    functioning

-   we also incorporated new features to enhance system performance

-   below, detailed technical descriptions associated with the
    reconfiguration

\-\--

-   1\. the headplate and the window frame were scaled to integrate a larger
    window

-   2\. raised rims were added to the bottom surface of the headplate where
    it contacts squamosal suture of mouse cranium to supplement
    skull-to-headplate attachment

    -   to accommodate for the restricted attachment area due to the
        removal of a larger fraction of parietal and frontal bone

-   3\. a thin skirt was added to the perimeter of the bottom surface of the
    optical insert which gently wraps around the intact tissue and prevents
    tissue ingrowth

    -   in replacement of the vertical column

    -   to accommodate for endocranium curves

-   4\. incorporated nuts and bolts to facilitate attachment/detachment
    between the modules

    -   in replacement of using dental cement

    -   allows fine height adjustment, positioning, and installation of
        the window without the use of stereotaxic apparatus

    -   added silicone coating to the chamber's inner walls that form a
        seal with the optical insert upon its attachment

-   5\. incorporated an auxiliary module that protects the integrity of the
    window using a magnetically-coupled protective cap

    -   in replacement of tape
