### Visualization

Once ROIs are established, all video data is reloaded and passed to a method in the _RegionOfInterest_ class that extracts the 1-dimensional trace for each ROI representing the fluorescence intensity in that region over time. The ROIs and their traces can then be interactively visualized using another method in the _RegionOfInterest_ class.

The _RegionOfInterest_ class defines methods for rapid spatial comparison operations which can typically be viewed as an adjacency matrix using built-in image viewing commands. Visualization of the segmented cell overlay and 1D traces can be manipulated by assigning colors, removing ROIs, hiding ROIs, and more.
