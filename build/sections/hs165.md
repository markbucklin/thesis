## Window detachment and replacement

The dental cement connecting the window and headplate was etched away
using a dental drill. Before removing the window, we thoroughly flushed
debris from the surrounding surfaces with sterile saline. Replacement
windows were installed using the same procedures described above for
initial attachment. Localizing the replacement window to the same
position was aided by the expansion of granulation tissue up to the
walls of the prior window.
