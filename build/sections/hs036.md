#### LEDs

High-intensity LEDs would be incorporated into the implant in favor of a traditional fiber-coupled laser primarily for their ability to _diffusely_ illuminate neurons over a _large area_ and their _scalability_, which would be vital for _multi-site_ and _chronic_ modulation. LEDs do not couple efficiently to optical fibers of small diameter  (\~200 microns is typical in optogenetics labs), but they can provide a far greater _luminous intensity_ in a greater variety of wavelengths than lasers, at a fraction of the cost. The proposed project would incorporate LEDs built into the implant, with their emitting surfaces _closely coupled to the_ _brain surface_.

LED arrays, and Digital Micromirror Devices  (DMDs) and Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LcoS) chips have been considered as a means of greater spatial control of light intensity; any of these would be incorporated if the technology improves during the lifetime of the project, but the current state of technology places heavy restrictions on space and/or power requirements to merit incorporation into the implant. Incorporating multiple LEDs (4 to 8) would enable semi-independent activation of neurons in widely-separated brain regions, the proposed project would need to _overlap_ this diffuse control with more precise targeted delivery of opsins (@packer_targeting_2013).

Here I describe the design strategy for the physical implant outlined above that would provide pathways to and from the mouse brain for the the electrodes and LEDs described above, as well as the circuit board that sits within this implant and consolidates all _input/output_ signals for connection with a computer. This project would strive to ensure the bidirectional chronic neural implant is _resilient_ to the abuse it would surely endure over the weeks to months of service _affixed to the cranium_ of a laboratory mouse. The outcome we wish to avoid is _movement_ of the penetrating electrodes within the brain tissue when external forces act on the implant, or when internal forces cause the animals brain to move relative to its skull. Moreover, if the electrode is unable to move with the brain there is substantial risk of electrode breakage.

We are designing the implant to address this potential issue from two directions: the first strategy is to make the implant as _tolerable_ for the animal as possible by minimizing its weight, rounding all edges, and fabricating with a bioinert material such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyetheretherketone (PEEK), and silicone elastomer. Elastomer or functionally similar material would be used to encase the printed circuit board (PCB) once electrodes are driven to their prescribed depth and electrical connections made. The encasement would cover the entirety of the board with the exception of two connectors for electrophysiology readout and LED power, and a heatsink connector for each LED . Heatsinks for the LEDs would either be copper tube or carbon fiber. The second strategy for minimizing electrode movement involves _floating_ the connection between the electrodes and the PCB. The goal of this procedure is to allow the electrode – with one end in the brain and the other in a plated through-hole – to move vertically and laterally relative to the PCB while maintaining electrical contact with the pad. The method for accomplishing this is still being developed; fortunately its success is not critical to the project, but merely an improvement.
