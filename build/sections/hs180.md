### Surface Classification: Peaks, Edges, Curvature

Edge-finding methods are employed for establishing boundaries between cells, and first and second-order gradients are used to compute local measures of curvature from an eigenvalue decomposition of the local Hessian matrix. I won't go into detail, as the utility of these procedure in the most recent implementation has been lost, but nevertheless, the operation is optimized and ready to be plugged back in when further development calls for better accuracy informing cell-segmentation, or when a faster or more accurate motion-correction algorithm is called for.
