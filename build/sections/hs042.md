#### Generation and Evaluation of Stimulus Paradigm

The highest level of processing would be implemented in a _non-real-time_ environment, MATLAB on Windows. Raw data and activity logs from the closed-loop routine would be written to disk continuously. A machine-learning routine would analyze these data and send updated parameters to the closed-loop computer as described below. All parameter updates would also be written to disk in synchrony with acquisition for retrospective analysis as described by [@sec:f31-aim3].
