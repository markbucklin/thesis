#### Motion Correction

In our application, the goal of a motion correction operation is to artificially suppress translation of the brain tissue parallel to the image plane. _Phase-Correlation_ (also referred to as _normalized cross-correlation_) has consistent performance across a range of image sources with varying spatial noise characteristics. However, a large non-uniform change from reference frames - such as occurs when cells with low baseline fluourescence are first activated - can cause drastic errors that must be recognized and corrected by a supervisory procedure. This can induce an undesirable, unpredicatable, and specifically inopportune latency Unfortunately in all the whole pipeline.

Unfortunately, "Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous"
