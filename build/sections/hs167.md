## Wide-field in vivo imaging and microscope setup

Wide-field epifluorescence imaging was accomplished using a custom
microscope equipped with a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu, ORCA Flash 4.0XX),
470 nm LED (Thorlabs, M470L3), excitation and emission filters of XX and
XX, a dichroic mirror (XX), and a 10x objective lens (Mitutoyo,
378-803-3). Mice were positioned under the microscope for imaging using
a custom headplate holder (Supplementary) and allowed to run on an
air-supported spherical treadmill^18^ as pictured in Figure 2 Step 5.
The camera recorded a field-of-view of approximately 1.3 mm x 1.3 mm
using an image resolution of 2048 x 2048 or more commonly 1024 x 1024.
Continuous image sequences were acquired at 40 to 60 frames-per-second
for 5 to 7 minutes. We selected the field to image within each site by
roughly centering around the injection site. To focus the microscope on
labeled cells in the superficial layers of cortex, we focused on the
surface vasculature to find a stable reference, then advanced the focal
plane 50 to 150 um until multiple cells were distinguishable. A
reference image of the selected image was recorded for each site and
used later to reacquire the same field across image sessions. Alignment
to this reference image relied primarily on using the major blood
vessels as landmarks to guide microscope position in the XY plane. Image
sequences were stored for subsequent processing and analysis.
