##### Concurrency: Parallel = Performance?

Not always, no. While concurrent processing of independent tasks or sequentially arriving data elements will almost always increase performance, this is not always the case. At a lower instruction-level than we typically program, synchronous operations can often be optimized in ways that asynchronous operations cannot, typically through strategic register allocation, or by taking cache-hit performance).
