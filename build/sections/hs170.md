## Figure 3 Extended optical clarity by biocompatible design of the system.

\(a) The space between the window and the skull filled with agarose is
progressively replaced by granulation tissue over time. At 6 month,
granulation tissue surrounds the polymer window and vasculature
formation is visible resembling a wound healing process. By 1 year, the
intermediate space is filled with tissue embedded with vasculatures. The
figures are from different animal that represent the corresponding
time-point from the initially window installation - the window was
installed using opaque Metabond on the samples for Day 0 and 1 year and
semi-clear Metabond on the sample for 6 month. (b) Snapshots with the
field-of-view of 1.3 x 1.3 mm were taken over the same regions on both
hemispheres using the major blood vessels as landmarks (circled same
regions). The optical clarity maintains over time to detect cellular
dynamics of individual cells. Some GCaMP6f labeled cells are visible. In
the left hemisphere, vascular remodelings are notable during the early
period.
