### Benchmarking & General Performance

Built-in MATLAB functions that execute on the GPU can be profiled with benchmarking functions like *gputimeit()*, or with the *tic/toc* functions. When execution isn't fast enough, they need to be replaced with custom functions. The custom functions typically achieve the speed up necessary by enabling the operation to carried out on several frames at once. This reduces the over-head costs inposed for each function call by spreading it over several frames. This solution is not ideal, as it increases the latency of solutions, however does not preclude implementation in real-time system if the procedures are adapted to run on a real-time hybrid system-on-module like NVIDIA's Tegra X1, which should involve minimal effort once a standard set of successful procedures is realized. The current implementation tests the processing time of each stage of the process to ensure that the sum is less than the acquisition time for each frame dictated by the inverse of the frame-rate (30-50 milliseconds).
