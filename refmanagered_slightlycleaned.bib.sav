	abstract = {Advances in fiber optic technology and miniaturized optics and mechanics have propelled confocal endomicroscopy into the clinical realm. This high resolution, non-invasive imaging technology provides the ability to microscopically evaluate cellular and sub-cellular features in tissue in vivo by optical sectioning. Because many cancers originate in epithelial tissues accessible by endoscopes, confocal endomicroscopy has been explored to detect regions of possible neoplasia at an earlier stage by imaging morphological features in vivo that are significant in histopathologic evaluation. This technique allows real-time assessment of tissue which may improve diagnostic yield by guiding biopsy. Research and development continues to reduce the overall size of the imaging probe, increase the image acquisition speed, and improve resolution and field of view of confocal endomicroscopes. Technical advances will continue to enable application to less accessible organs and more complex systems in the body. Lateral and axial resolutions down to 0.5 and 3 μm, respectively, field of view as large as 800 × 450 μm, and objective lens and total probe outer diameters down to 0.35 and 1.25 mm, respectively, have been achieved. We provide a review of the historical developments of confocal imaging in vivo, the evolution of endomicroscope instrumentation, and the medical applications of confocal endomicroscopy.},

This is achieved using a conventional (perpendicular) angle of approach with a probe held in one micromanipulator to visually guide the placement of the angled micromanipulator which holds a second probe. The technique may be used to derive angular approach coordinates for any angle in the coronal and/or sagittal planes. Once the coordinates are derived, they may be used with a single micromanipulator, as in the case of conventional placements. The derivation of the angular approach coordinates involves simple subtraction; no trigonometrical calculations are used. This method is simple and efficient.},

	abstract = {Effective estimation of the salience of environmental stimuli underlies adaptive behavior, while related aberrance is believed to undermine rational thought processes in schizophrenia. A network including bilateral frontoinsular cortex (FIC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been observed to respond to salient stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To test the hypothesis that activity in this salience network (SN) is less discriminately modulated by contextually-relevant stimuli in schizophrenia than in healthy individuals, fMRI data were collected in 20 individuals with schizophrenia and 13 matched controls during performance of a modified monetary incentive delay (MID) task. After quantitatively identifying spatial components representative of the FIC and dACC features of the SN, two principal analyses were conducted. In the first, modulation of SN activity by salience was assessed by measuring response to trial outcome. First-level general linear models were applied to individual-specific time-courses of SN activity identified using spatial independent component analysis (ICA). This analysis revealed a significant salience-by-performance-by-group interaction on the best-fit FIC component's activity at trial outcome, whereby healthy individuals but not individuals with schizophrenia exhibited greater distinction between the response to hits and misses in high salience trials than in low salience trials. The second analysis aimed to ascertain whether SN component amplitude differed between the study groups over the duration of the experiment. Independent-samples T-tests on back-projected, percent-signal-change scaled SN component images importantly showed that the groups did not differ in the overall amplitude of SN expression over the entire dataset. These findings of dysregulated but not decreased SN activity in schizophrenia provide physiological support for mechanistic conceptual frameworks of delusional thought formation.},

Compared with previous works using voxel-based media discretization, a mesh-based approach can be more accurate in modeling targets with curved boundaries or locally refined structures. We implement an efficient ray-tracing technique using Plücker Coordinates. The Barycentric coordinates computed from Plücker-formed ray-tracing enables us to use linear Lagrange basis functions to model both media properties and fluence distribution, leading to further improvement in accuracy. The Plücker-coordinate ray-polygon intersection test can be extended to hexahedral or high-order elements. Excellent agreement is found when comparing mesh-based MC with the analytical diffusion model and 3D voxel-based MC code in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. Realistic time-resolved imaging results are observed for a complex human brain anatomy using mesh-based MC. We also include multi-threading support in the software and will port it to a graphics processing unit platform in the near future.},

High spatial resolution oxygen imaging is of particular importance because recent studies address the significance of within-tissue and within-cell heterogeneities in oxygen concentration in health and disease. Here, we report a new technique for in vivo molecular imaging of oxygen in organs using green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP-expressing COS-7 cells were briefly photoactivated with a strong blue light while lowering the oxygen concentration from 10\% to {\textless}0.001\%. Red fluorescence (excitation 520–550 nm, emission {\textgreater}580 nm) appeared after photoactivation at {\textless}2\% oxygen (the red shift of GFP fluorescence). The red shift disappeared after reoxygenation of the cell, indicating that the red shift is stable as long as the cell is hypoxic. The red shift of GFP fluorescence was also demonstrated in single cardiomyocytes isolated from the GFP knock-in mouse (green mouse) heart. Then, we tried in vivo molecular imaging of hypoxia in organs. The red shift could be imaged in the ischemic liver and kidney in the green mouse using macroscopic optics provided that oxygen diffusion from the atmospheric air was prevented. In crystalloid-perfused beating heart isolated from the green mouse, significant spatial heterogeneities in the red shift were demonstrated in the epicardium distal to the coronary artery ligation. We conclude that the present technique using GFP as an oxygen indicator may allow in vivo molecular imaging of oxygen in organs.},

A probe constructed from optical fibers is used to deliver excitation light and collect fluorescence from seven positions, each 1 mm apart, through the left ventricle wall of the rabbit heart. Excitation is provided by the 488-nm line of a water-cooled argon-ion laser. The fluorescence of the voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS from each tissue site is split at 600 nm and imaged onto separate photodiodes for later signal ratioing. The optics and electronics are easily expandable to accommodate multiple optical probes.

Corticothalamic slow oscillations of neuronal activity determine internal brain states. At least in the cortex, the electrical activity is associated with large neuronal Ca2+ transients. Here we implemented an optogenetic approach to explore causal features of the generation of slow oscillation-associated Ca2+ waves in the in vivo mouse brain. We demonstrate that brief optogenetic stimulation (3–20 ms) of a local group of layer 5 cortical neurons is sufficient for the induction of global brain Ca2+ waves. These Ca2+ waves are evoked in an all-or-none manner, exhibit refractoriness during repetitive stimulation, and propagate over long distances. By local optogenetic stimulation, we demonstrate that evoked Ca2+ waves initially invade the cortex, followed by a secondary recruitment of the thalamus. Together, our results establish that synchronous activity in a small cluster of layer 5 cortical neurons can initiate a global neuronal wave of activity suited for long-range corticothalamic integration.},

Existing approaches for delivering light to cells expressing ChR2 rely upon microscopes, lasers, arc lamps and shutters, all of which are relatively expensive and are not readily scalable for use on more than one brain region or animal at a time. In this paper, we describe an inexpensive method for delivering blue light locally and with millisecond precision to cells expressing ChR2. We accomplished this by coupling the light from a high-intensity blue light-emitting diode (LED; XLamp XR-E from CREE) into an optical fiber. When positioned in proximity to ChR2-expressing HEK293 cells, this fiber-coupled LED provided localized illumination of up to 32 mW/mm2 and generated ChR2 photocurrents as efficiently as wide-field mercury arc lamp illumination. This fiber-coupled LED was also used to photostimulate action potentials in ChR2-expressing dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. LED light power and pulse frequency were controlled with an inexpensive, custom-built amplifier circuit. This scalable fiber-coupled LED system can be used to deliver light independent of the microscope objective and could, in principle, deliver light in parallel to multiple brain regions or to multiple genetically engineered animals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses some of the motivational drives behind opiate addiction discovered over approximately 80 years of studies of opiate self-administration in animals. The focus of the discussion is on regulation of opiate intake by physiological dependence, pain, and learned habits. Drug intake by animals is fairly well regulated by satiety levels. Under appropriate experimental conditions, a satiety level can be altered by physiological dependence or pain. Furthermore, during self-administration, there are several sources of learning that will modulate drug intake. It is concluded that these drives and learning dynamically interact with each other to influence the direction and the strength of opiate habits.},

Using light, we are able to visualize the hemodynamic behavior of the brain to better understand neurovascular coupling and cerebral metabolism. In vivo optical imaging of tissue using endogenous chromophores necessitates spectroscopic detection to ensure molecular specificity as well as sufficiently high imaging speed and signal-to-noise ratio, to allow dynamic physiological changes to be captured, isolated, and used as surrogate of pathophysiological processes. An optical imaging system is introduced using a 16-bands on-chip hyperspectral camera. Using this system, we show that up to three dyes can be imaged and quantified in a tissue phantom at video-rate through the optics of a surgical microscope. In vivo human patient data are presented demonstrating brain hemodynamic response can be measured intraoperatively with molecular specificity at high speed.},

In this paper, we compare two Active Computer Vision methods frequently used for the 3D reconstruction of objects from image sequences, acquired with a single off-the-shelf CCD camera: Structure From Motion (SFM) and Generalized Voxel Coloring (GVC). SFM recovers the 3D shape of an object based on the relative motion involved, while VC is a volumetric method that uses photo-consistency measures to build the required 3D model.

	abstract = {Optical fibers are commonly inserted into living tissues such as the brain in order to deliver light to deep targets for neuroscientific and neuroengineering applications such as optogenetics, in which light is used to activate or silence neurons expressing specific photosensitive proteins. However, an optical fiber is limited to delivering light to a single target within the three-dimensional structure of the brain. We here demonstrate a multiwaveguide probe capable of independently delivering light to multiple targets along the probe axis, thus enabling versatile optical control of sets of distributed brain targets. The 1.45-cm-long probe is microfabricated in the form of a 360-μm-wide array of 12 parallel silicon oxynitride (SiON) multimode waveguides clad with SiO2 and coated with aluminum; probes of custom dimensions are easily created as well. The waveguide array accepts light from a set of sources at the input end and guides the light down each waveguide to an aluminum corner mirror that efficiently deflects light away from the probe axis. Light losses at each stage are small (input coupling loss, 0.4±0.3dB; bend loss, negligible; propagation loss, 3.1±1dB/cm using the outscattering method and 3.2±0.4dB/cm using the cutback method; corner mirror loss, 1.5±0.4dB); a waveguide coupled, for example, to a 5mW source will deliver over 1.5mW to a target at a depth of 1cm.},

Since evidence accumulates that NIBS might be able to modulate oscillatory activity and related behavior in a scientific setting, this review focuses on discussing potential interventional strategies to target abnormalities in oscillatory activity in neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, we will review oscillatory changes described in patients after stroke, with PD or suffering from SCZ.

We have recently provided novel empirical evidence for a mechanism in which a communicator selects his actions on the basis of a prediction of the communicative intentions that an addressee is most likely to attribute to those actions. The main novelty of those findings was that this prediction of intention recognition is cerebrally implemented within the intention recognition system of the communicator, is modulated by the ambiguity in meaning of the communicative acts, and not by their sensorimotor complexity. The characteristics of this predictive mechanism support the notion that human communicative abilities are distinct from both sensorimotor and linguistic processes.},

	abstract = {The ability to optimize behavioural performance when confronted with continuously evolving environmental demands is a key element of human cognition. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which lies on the medial surface of the frontal lobes, is important in regulating cognitive control. Hypotheses about its function include guiding reward-based decision making, monitoring for conflict between competing responses and predicting task difficulty. Precise mechanisms of dACC function remain unknown, however, because of the limited number of human neurophysiological studies. Here we use functional imaging and human single-neuron recordings to show that the firing of individual dACC neurons encodes current and recent cognitive load. We demonstrate that the modulation of current dACC activity by previous activity produces a behavioural adaptation that accelerates reactions to cues of similar difficulty to previous ones, and retards reactions to cues of different difficulty. Furthermore, this conflict adaptation, or Gratton effect, is abolished after surgically targeted ablation of the dACC. Our results demonstrate that the dACC provides a continuously updated prediction of expected cognitive demand to optimize future behavioural responses. In situations with stable cognitive demands, this signal promotes efficiency by hastening responses, but in situations with changing demands it engenders accuracy by delaying responses.},

Using cell-type-specific electrophysiology, cellular imaging and optogenetic perturbation, we show that layer 5 neurons projecting within the cortex have unbiased laterality. Activity with a contralateral population bias arises specifically in layer 5 neurons projecting to the brainstem, and only late during movement planning. These results reveal the transformation of distributed preparatory activity into movement commands within hierarchically organized cortical circuits.},

Brain mechanisms underlying nicotine IVSA, as well as the effects of pharmacological interventions, have also been widely investigated and are summarized. However, the conditions under which nicotine self-administration has been observed do not closely model the way in which nicotine is consumed by cigarette smokers, in two important respects: conventional IVSA procedures typically employ ultra-rapid infusions and high unit doses of nicotine that approximate the content of one or two cigarettes. In contrast, recent evidence shows that rats will also self-administer nicotine in doses equivalent to about two cigarette puffs, delivered into the circulation at a much slower rate that more closely approximates the delivery rate in cigarette smokers. Possibly, adoption of these refinements will help to provide an animal model with greater predictive clinical validity in order to advance the search for more effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies.},

L'atteinte cardiaque dans la maladie de Lyme est relativement rare. Elle survient en moyenne trois semaines aprÃ¨s la contamination, et rÃ©sulte alors d'une atteinte directe par la Borrelia, que l'on a pu isoler dans le myocarde et le pÃ©ricarde. Elle peut persister ou Ãªtre plus tardive, le mÃ©canisme de ces formes tardives est discutÃ©, atteinte directe du myocarde par BorreliaÂ burgdorferi ou plus vraisemblablement mÃ©canisme auto-immun. Elle se rÃ©sume le plus souvent Ã  une myocardite a minima s'exprimant par des troubles de conduction bÃ©nins et rÃ©gressifs, n'amenant pas Ã  l'implantation d'un stimulateur dÃ©finitif. Plus rarement, il s'agit de myocardite ou myopÃ©ricardite Ã  expression plus globale avec douleurs, troubles de repolarisation, pouvant simuler un infarctus du myocarde, donner des troubles du rythme, des anomalies Ã©chographiques ventriculaires et/ou pÃ©ricardiques, et mÃªme une insuffisance cardiaque, et Ã©voluant le plus souvent vers la guÃ©rison spontanÃ©e, le rÃ´le de l'antibiothÃ©rapie dans l'obtention de la guÃ©rison est suggÃ©rÃ©. Des formes plus graves avec myocardiopathie sÃ©vÃ¨re sont trÃ¨s rares. Le diagnostic de maladie de Lyme repose sur la mÃªme combinaison d'Ã©lÃ©ments cliniques et de tests de laboratoires que dans les formes sans atteinte cardiaque, mais la constatation de troubles de conduction aigus chez un sujet jeune est particuliÃ¨rement Ã©vocatrice et doit faire rechercher la maladie. Le traitement est le mÃªme que pour les autres atteintes de la maladie.
 
Cardiac manifestations of Lyme Borreliosis are relatively infrequent, occurring within weeks after the infectious tick bite (median of 21Â days), and resulting at this stage from a direct borrelial infection of the myocardium, as indicated by reports of spirochete isolation from pericardium and myocardium. They may persist or appear in the late, tertiary phase of the illness, being then more likely due to infection-triggered autoimmunity. Lyme carditis typically presents with a fluctuating degree of atrioventricular block that spontaneously resolves in several days. Rarely, myocarditis may occur with or without pericardial involvement, in patients presenting with chest pain, ST depression or T wave inversion, mimicking an acute myocardial infarction, and various arrhythmias are reported, as well as pericardial effusion or heart failure. A complete recovery is usually observed, spontaneous or after antibiotherapy. Severe myocarditis or Pericarditis leading to death is exceptional. The diagnosis of Lyme carditis is based on the same association of clinical and laboratory features as in Lyme disease without cardiac involvement. But the occurrence of conduction disturbances in healthy young people suggests screening for other criteria of Lyme disease. The management of Lyme carditis does not differ from the treatment of Lyme disease without carditis and is mainly based upon the use of doxycycline or ceftriaxone.},

The root of our brain's computational power lies in its trillions of connections. With our increasing ability to study these connections experimentally comes the need for analytical tools that can be used to develop meaningful quantitative characterizations. In this manuscript, we present a new such tool, incremental mutual information (IMI), that enables the characterization of the strength and dynamics of the connection between a pair of neurons based on the statistical dependencies in their spiking activity. IMI is an important step forward from existing approaches, as it has the potential to disambiguate dependencies due to the connection between two neurons from those due to other sources, such as shared external inputs, provided that the dependencies have appropriate timescales. We demonstrate the utility of IMI through the analysis of simulated neuronal activity as well as activity recorded in the primate visual system.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.01.020},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances in genetically engineered calcium and membrane potential indicators provide the potential to estimate the activation dynamics of individual neurons within larger, mesoscale networks (100s-1000+neurons). However, a fully integrated automated workflow for the analysis and visualization of neural microcircuits from high speed fluorescence imaging data is lacking.
NEW METHOD: Here we introduce FluoroSNNAP, Fluorescence Single Neuron and Network Analysis Package. FluoroSNNAP is an open-source, interactive software developed in MATLAB for automated quantification of numerous biologically relevant features of both the calcium dynamics of single-cells and network activity patterns. FluoroSNNAP integrates and improves upon existing tools for spike detection, synchronization analysis, and inference of functional connectivity, making it most useful to experimentalists with little or no programming knowledge.
RESULTS: We apply FluoroSNNAP to characterize the activity patterns of neuronal microcircuits undergoing developmental maturation in vitro. Separately, we highlight the utility of single-cell analysis for phenotyping a mixed population of neurons expressing a human mutant variant of the microtubule associated protein tau and wild-type tau.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): We show the performance of semi-automated cell segmentation using spatiotemporal independent component analysis and significant improvement in detecting calcium transients using a template-based algorithm in comparison to peak-based or wavelet-based detection methods. Our software further enables automated analysis of microcircuits, which is an improvement over existing methods.
CONCLUSIONS: We expect the dissemination of this software will facilitate a comprehensive analysis of neuronal networks, promoting the rapid interrogation of circuits in health and disease.},

	abstract = {Since the 1960s, deep brain stimulation and spinal cord stimulation at low frequency (30 Hz) have been used to treat intractable pain of various origins. For this purpose, specific hardware have been designed, including deep brain electrodes, extensions, and implantable programmable generators (IPGs). In the meantime, movement disorders, and particularly parkinsonian and essential tremors, were treated by electrolytic or mechanic lesions in various targets of the basal ganglia, particularly in the thalamus and in the internal pallidum. The advent in the 1960s of levodopa, as well as the side effects and complications of ablative surgery (e.g., thalamotomy and pallidotomy), has sent functional neurosurgery of movement disorders to oblivion. In 1987, the serendipitous discovery of the effect of high-frequency stimulation (HFS), mimicking lesions, allowed the revival of the surgery of movement disorders by stimulation of the thalamus, which treated tremors with limited morbidity, and adaptable and reversible results. The stability along time of these effects allowed extending it to new targets suggested by basic research in monkeys. The HFS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has profoundly challenged the practice of functional surgery as the effect on the triad of dopaminergic symptoms was very significant, allowing to decrease the drug dosage and therefore a decrease of their complications, the levodopa-induced dyskinesias.

In the meantime, based on the results of previous basic research in various fields, HFS has been progressively extended to potentially treat epilepsy and, more recently, psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive–compulsive disorders, Gilles de la Tourette tics, and severe depression. Similarly, suggested by the observation of changes in PET scan, applications have been extended to cluster headaches by stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus and even more recently, to obesity and drug addiction.

In the field of movement disorders, it has become clear that STN stimulation is not efficient on the nondopaminergic symptoms such as freezing of gait. Based on experimental data obtained in MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys, the pedunculopontine nucleus has been used as a new target, and as suggested by the animal research results, its use indeed improves walking and stability when stimulation is performed at low frequency (25 Hz). The concept of simultaneous stimulation of multiple targets eventually at low or high frequency, and that of several electrodes in one target, is being accepted to increase the efficiency. This leads to and is being facilitated by the development of new hardware (multiple-channel IPGs, specific electrodes, rechargeable batteries). Still additional efforts are needed at the level of the stimulation paradigm and in the waveform. The recent development of nanotechnologies allows the design of totally new systems expanding the field of deep brain stimulation. These new techniques will make it possible to not only inhibit or excite deep brain structures to alleviate abnormal symptoms but also open the field for the use of recording cortical activities to drive neuroprostheses through brain–computer interfaces. The new field of compensation of deficits will then become part of the field of functional neurosurgery.},

Thus, time-encoded data can be used to recover depth information while photon exiting point is exploited for lateral localization. This approach was tested against simulations, demonstrating both detection and localization capabilities. Preliminary measurements on inhomogeneous phantoms showed good detection sensibility, even for a low optical perturbation, and localization capabilities, yet with decreasing spatial resolution for increasing depths.

Optogenetics is one large step toward achieving this goal, yet optical methods to control neural activity in behaving rodents have so far been limited to perturbing all light-sensitive neurons in a large volume. Here we demonstrate an all-optical method for precise spatial control and recording of neuronal activity in anesthetized and awake freely behaving mice. Photoactivation patterns targeted to multiple neuronal somata, produced with computer-generated holography, were transmitted to the mouse brain using a micro-objective-coupled fiber bundle. Fluorescence imaging through the same device, via epifluorescence, structured illumination, or scanless multipoint confocal microscopy, allowed imaging of neurons and recording of neuronal activity. The fiberscope was tested in mice coexpressing ChR2-tdTomato and GCaMP5-G in cerebellar interneurons, delivering near-cellular resolution photoactivation in freely behaving mice.},

	abstract = {Objective. Maintenance of cognitive control is a major concern for many human disease conditions; therefore, a major goal of human neuroprosthetics is to facilitate and/or recover the cognitive function when such circumstances impair appropriate decision making. Approach. Minicolumnar activity from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was recorded from nonhuman primates trained to perform a delayed match to sample (DMS), via custom-designed conformal multielectrode arrays that provided inter-laminar recordings from neurons in the PFC layer 2/3 and layer 5. Such recordings were analyzed via a previously demonstrated nonlinear multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) neuroprosthesis in rodents, which extracted and characterized multicolumnar firing patterns during DMS performance. Main results. The MIMO model verified that the conformal recorded individual PFC minicolumns responded to entrained target selections in patterns critical for successful DMS performance. This allowed the substitution of task-related layer 5 neuron firing patterns with electrical stimulation in the same recording regions during columnar transmission from layer 2/3 at the time of target selection. Such stimulation improved normal task performance, but more importantly, recovered performance when applied as a neuroprosthesis following the pharmacological disruption of decision making in the same task. Significance. These findings provide the first successful application of neuroprosthesis in the primate brain designed specifically to restore or repair the disrupted cognitive function.},

However, the relative clinical efficacy of regular versus non-regular temporal patterns of stimulation in Parkinson's disease remains unclear. To determine the temporal characteristics of non-regular temporal patterns of stimulation important for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, we compared the efficacy of temporally regular stimulation with four non-regular patterns of stimulation in subjects with Parkinson's disease using an alternating finger tapping task. The patterns of stimulation were also evaluated in a biophysical model of the parkinsonian basal ganglia that exhibited prominent oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range. The temporal patterns of stimulation differentially improved motor task performance. Three of the non-regular patterns of stimulation improved performance of the finger tapping task more than temporally regular stimulation. In the computational model all patterns of deep brain stimulation suppressed beta band oscillatory activity, and the degree of suppression was strongly correlated with the clinical efficacy across stimulation patterns. The three non-regular patterns of stimulation that improved motor performance over regular stimulation also suppressed beta band oscillatory activity in the computational model more effectively than regular stimulation. These data demonstrate that the temporal pattern of stimulation is an important consideration for the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, non-regular patterns of stimulation may ameliorate motor symptoms and suppress pathological rhythmic activity in the basal ganglia more effectively than regular stimulation. Therefore, non-regular patterns of deep brain stimulation may have useful clinical and experimental applications.},

This includes biological and environmental factors that predispose individuals to develop either disorder, an increased risk for anxiety and depression when the disorders are present, and heightened trait levels of impulsivity and compulsion. Animal models of eating disorders are not as well established as those that model drug addiction, but the research in this area is progressing rapidly. In this chapter, we discuss anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and obesity as these encompass the majority of maladaptive eating behaviors in humans. We begin by outlining the important features that characterize each disorder and that should thereby be present in an animal model. An overview of peptide control of feeding is provided to help the reader evaluate the animal models presented. These are based principally on genetic variation and stressful life events. In general, most animal models based on genetic alterations have limited applicability to humans, at least to date. Those based on stressful life events appear more promising in that they more accurately reproduce alterations in feeding and neuroendocrine function that are characteristic of each disorder. The next obvious step in eating disorder research is to combine the two approaches to determine how genetic alterations and stressful events interact to produce maladaptive eating and physiological changes.},

	abstract = {Previous work has reported that it is not difficult to give people the illusion of ownership over an artificial body, providing a powerful tool for the investigation of the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying body perception and self consciousness. We present an experimental study that uses immersive virtual reality (IVR) focused on identifying the perceptual building blocks of this illusion. We systematically manipulated visuotactile and visual sensorimotor contingencies, visual perspective, and the appearance of the virtual body in order to assess their relative role and mutual interaction. Consistent results from subjective reports and physiological measures showed that a first person perspective over a fake humanoid body is essential for eliciting a body ownership illusion. We found that the illusion of ownership can be generated when the virtual body has a realistic skin tone and spatially substitutes the real body seen from a first person perspective. In this case there is no need for an additional contribution of congruent visuotactile or sensorimotor cues. Additionally, we found that the processing of incongruent perceptual cues can be modulated by the level of the illusion: when the illusion is strong, incongruent cues are not experienced as incorrect. Participants exposed to asynchronous visuotactile stimulation can experience the ownership illusion and perceive touch as originating from an object seen to contact the virtual body. Analogously, when the level of realism of the virtual body is not high enough and/or when there is no spatial overlap between the two bodies, then the contribution of congruent multisensory and/or sensorimotor cues is required for evoking the illusion. On the basis of these results and inspired by findings from neurophysiological recordings in the monkey, we propose a model that accounts for many of the results reported in the literature.},

Both implicit and explicit finite element schemes for unstructured grids are implemented and discussed. Several application simulations using three tissue grids of varying degrees of physiological accuracy are then conducted, and figures for the optical pathlength of light through the tissue at varying levels of oxygenation are computed.

Gamma oscillations have been reported in a distributed network involving the basal ganglia, thalamus and motor cortex, and have been described in a wide range of diseases as well as during increased arousal and voluntary movement. In Parkinson's disease, gamma activity is promoted by dopaminergic therapy. These features suggest that its elevation may be involved in the production of movement and this hypothesis is supported by the correlation between the amplitude of gamma activity and limb kinematics. Here we review these data, discuss the functional anatomy of gamma activity in basal ganglia and question how closely it relates to the coding of movement parameters.},

By following segregating genetic markers linked to these traits in (B6 x D2) recombinant inbred (BXD RI) mice, the study defined 2 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the B220\% phenotype: Pbbcp1 (peripheral blood B cell percentage 1, logarithm of odds [LOD] 4.1, P {\textless}.000 01) and Pbbcp2 (LOD 3.7, P {\textless}.000 04) on chromosome 1 (Chr 1) at about 63 cM and 48 cM; one suggestive locus for the CD4\% phenotype (LOD 2.6, P {\textless}.000 57) on Chr 8 at about 73 cM; and one QTL for the CD8\% phenotype: Pbctlp1 (peripheral blood cytotoxic T lymphocyte percentage 1, LOD 3.8, P {\textless}.000 02) on Chr 19 at about 12 cM.

In both BXD RI and B6SJLF2 mice, QTLs regulating B-cell proportions showed no significant effect on T-cell proportions and vice versa.

	abstract = {Fluorescent calcium indicators are becoming increasingly popular as a means for observing the spiking activity of large neuronal populations. Unfortunately, extracting the spike train of each neuron from a raw fluorescence movie is a nontrivial problem. This work presents a fast nonnegative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike train of each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener filter. The algorithm runs in linear time, and is fast enough that even when simultaneously imaging {\textgreater}100 neurons, inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than real time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines the inferred spike train estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.},

We have established a simple and highly effective method for the reduction of AAFs that are ubiquitous in fixed mammalian brain and other tissues. A compact AAF-quenching photo-irradiation device was constructed using a commercially available light emitting diode (LED) array, cooling unit, and supporting components. The LED panel is comprised of an array of multispectral high intensity LEDs which serve as the illumination source for the photo-irradiation process. Rabbit and cat brain specimens of 5 μm- and 40 μm-thicknesses, respectively, were photo-irradiated for various durations. The AAFs were reduced to near tissue background levels after 24 h of treatment for both deparaffinized and paraffinized rabbit brain specimens, and for the free-floating cat brain specimens. Subsequent immunofluorescence staining using primary antibodies against GFAP, NeuN, Iba-1, and MAP-2, and the corresponding Qdot® and Alexafluor® fluoroconjugates confirmed that the LED photo-irradiation treatment did not compromise the efficiency of the immunofluorescence labeling. The use of the device is not labor intensive, and only requires minimal tissue processing and experimental set-up time, with very low maintenance and operating costs. Finally, multiple specimens, in both slide and well-plate format, can be simultaneously photo-irradiated, thus, allowing for scalable batch processing.},

	abstract = {Optogenetics has proven to be a revolutionary technology in neuroscience and has advanced continuously over the past decade. However, optical stimulation technologies for in vivo need to be developed to match the advances in genetics and biochemistry that have driven this field. In particular, conventional approaches for in vivo optical illumination have a limitation on the achievable spatio-temporal resolution. Here we utilize a sapphire-based microscale gallium nitride light-emitting diode (μLED) probe to activate neocortical neurons in vivo. The probes were designed to contain independently controllable multiple μLEDs, emitting at 450 nm wavelength with an irradiance of up to 2 W/mm2. Monte-Carlo stimulations predicted that optical stimulation using a μLED can modulate neural activity within a localized region. To validate this prediction, we tested this probe in the mouse neocortex that expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and compared the results with optical stimulation through a fiber at the cortical surface. We confirmed that both approaches reliably induced action potentials in cortical neurons and that the μLED probe evoked strong responses in deep neurons. Due to the possibility to integrate many optical stimulation sites onto a single shank, the μLED probe is thus a promising approach to control neurons locally in vivo.},

In this research, a novel implantable imaging system for fluorescence potentiometry was developed using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and its application to the analysis of cultured brain slices and the brain of a living mouse is described. A CMOS image sensor, small enough to be implanted into the brain, with light-emitting diodes and an absorbing filter was developed to enable real-time fluorescence imaging. The sensor, in conjunction with a voltage-sensitive dye, was certainly able to visualize the potential statuses of neurons and obtain physiological responses in both right and left visual cortex simultaneously by using multiple sensors for the first time. This accomplished multiplanar and multipoint measurement provides multidimensional information from different aspects. The light microsensors do not disturb the animal behavior. This implies that the imaging system can combine functional fluorescence imaging in the brain with behavioral experiments in a freely moving animal.},

The present study validates a method for continuous measurement of the local EP responses during focal cortical infarction induced via photothrombosis. Single microwire electrodes were acutely implanted into the primary auditory cortex of eight rats. Multi-unit neural activity, evoked via a continuous 2 Hz click stimulus, was recorded before, during and after infarction to assess neuronal function in response to local, permanent ischemia. During sham infarction, the average stimulus-evoked peak firing rate over 20 min remained stable at 495.5 ± 14.5 spikes s –1 , indicating temporal stability of neural function under normal conditions. Stimulus-evoked peak firing was reliably reduced to background levels (firing frequency in the absence of stimulus) following initiation of photothrombosis over a period of 439 ± 92 s. The post-infarction firing patterns exhibited unique temporal degradation of the peak firing rate, suggesting a variable response to ischemic challenge. Despite the inherent complexity of cerebral ischemia secondary to microvascular occlusion, complete loss of EP function consistently occurred 300–600 s after photothrombosis. The results suggest that microwire recording during photothrombosis provides a simple and highly efficacious strategy for assessing the electrophysiological dynamics of cortical infarction.},

Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100\% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 pA at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because pH excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue–green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of ‘optogenetic’ voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuroscientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations.},

	abstract = {Summary
Cranioplasty is a procedure commonly performed by plastic surgeons involved in craniofacial surgery, in which it is generally accepted that the ideal reconstructive material is autogenous bone. When this is not available or when its use is inappropriate, alloplastic materials are the next best option. A retrospective analysis was carried out to review the senior author's experience of 98 cranioplasties with methylmethacrylate (MM) from 1980 to 2001. The site and size of the implant and complications thereof were recorded and an assessment of the quality of the final result made.

The patients were divided into two groups:

Group 1: Methylmethacrylate as a full thickness inlay.

Group 2: Methylmethacrylate as an onlay only.

In group 1 there were 32 patients for whom the average follow up was 8.2 years (range 2–16 years). In group 2 there were 66 patients with an average follow up of 7.1 years (range 2–20 years). After a minimum follow up of 2 years, 89 out of 98 of the patients retained their implants. Nine implants in total were removed. Of the 89 patients retaining their implants, 85 had excellent or good results at long-term follow up. The infection and implant removal rate was very high if nasal or frontal sinus tissue was in direct contact with the implant during the operative procedure.

The keys to the successful use of methylmethacrylate are discussed and representative case examples are presented. There is increasing evidence that the long term results of newer alternatives to methylmethacrylate for cranioplasty such as hydroxyapatite cement are disappointing and do not justify their expense. Methylmethacrylate is cheap, readily available and easy to use and it remains the alloplastic material of choice for cranioplasty in our hands.},

This creates a powerful quantitative bioimaging tool that can generate spatially resolved mobility and interaction maps with hundreds to thousands of pixels per sample. These massively parallel imaging schemes also cause less photodamage than conventional single-point confocal microscopy–based FCS/FCCS. Here we provide guidelines for imaging FCS/FCCS measurements on commercial and custom-built microscopes (including sample preparation, setup calibration, data acquisition and evaluation), as well as anticipated results for a variety of in vitro and in vivo samples. For a skilled user of an available SPIM or TIRF setup, sample preparation, microscope alignment, data acquisition and data fitting, as described in this protocol, will take {\textasciitilde}1 d, depending on the sample and the mode of imaging.},

	abstract = {This study reports extensive characterization of the silicone gel (3-4680, Dow Corning, Midland, MI), for potential use as an artificial dural sealant in long-term electrophysiological experiments in neurophysiology. Dural sealants are important to preserve the integrity of the intracranial space after a craniotomy and in prolonging the lifetime and functionality of implanted brain probes. In this study, we report results of our tests on a commercially available silicone gel with unique properties that make it an ideal dural substitute. The substitute is transparent, elastic, easy to apply, and has re-sealing capabilities, which makes it desirable for applications where multiple penetrations by the brain probe is desirable over an extended period of time. Cytotoxicity tests (for up to 10 days) with fibroblasts and in vivo tests (for 12 weeks) show that the gel is non-toxic and does not produce any significant neuronal degeneration when applied to the rodent cortex even after 12 weeks. In vivo humidity testing showed no sign of CSF leakage for up to 6 weeks. The gel also allows silicon microprobes to penetrate with forces less than 0.5 mN, and a 200-μm diameter stainless steel microprobe with a blunt tip to penetrate with a force less than 2.5 mN. The force dependency on the velocity of penetration and thickness of the gel was also quantified and empirically modeled. The above results demonstrate that the silicone gel (3-4680) can be a viable dural substitute in long-term electrophysiology of the brain.},

The gold nanoelectrode array was fabricated by template-assisted electrodeposition on general electrodes, which shows an ordered well-defined 3D structure of nanowires. The sensitivity of the gold NEA to hydrogen peroxide is 37 times higher than that of the conventional electrode. The linear range of the platinum NEA toward H2O2 is from 1 × 10−6 to 1 × 10−2 M, covering four orders of magnitudes with detection limit of 1 × 10−7 M and a single noise ratio (S/N) of four. The enzyme electrode exhibits an excellent response performance to glucose with linear range from 1 × 10−5 to 1 × 10−2 M and a fast response time within 8 s. The Michaelis–Menten constant km and the maximum current density i max of the enzyme electrode were 4.97 mM and 84.60 μA cm−2, respectively. This special nanoelectrode may find potential application in other biosensors based on amperometric signals.},

	abstract = {A variety of animal models have been developed to mimic the interactions between drugs and environment that are thought to play a crucial role in human addiction. A history of exposure to stress, for example, facilitates the development of drug addiction and drug relapse. Furthermore, there is solid evidence that drug-related contextual cues (i.e., environmental stimuli paired with drug taking that have acquired conditioned stimulus properties) can precipitate drug seeking in both humans and animals, indicating the importance of associative learning processes. Finally, there is some evidence (mostly of anecdotal nature) that the circumstances immediately surrounding drug taking can modulate drug intake in ways that are not easily reducible to conditioning or stress. In the past few years some effort has been made to investigate this latter type of drug-environment interaction using animal models. Most importantly, we have recently shown that the context can modulate the reinforcing effects of addictive drugs independently of its physical characteristics. In these studies, some animals were transferred to the test cages immediately before the treatment (Non Resident group), whereas other animals were kept at all times in the test cages (Resident group). Some studies were conducted using a single drug, whereas others employed a polydrug taking procedure. In the present chapter, we will review not only the results obtained using this animal model but also those yielded by translational studies conducted in human addicts. Finally, we will discuss the implications of these findings for the study of drug addiction in humans and animals.},

The DBS consists of two short lasting, 50-Hz tetanic stimuli or bursts separated by a 750-ms interval. The response to this pattern of stimulation is two single separated muscle contractions of which the second is less than the first during nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade. The ability to identify fade manually at different train-of-four (TOF) ratios was compared in four DBS patterns in which different numbers of impulses in the individual bursts were combined. The DBS with three impulses in each burst (DBS3,3) was considered to be the most sensitive and the least painful and thus most suitable for clinical use. The degree of fade in TOF and DBS3,3 was almost identical at any level of blockade (correlation coefficient 0.96), and the major post-DBS3,3 effect was a depression of the first twitch in TOF lasting less than 15 s. It is concluded that the DBS is more sensitive than the TOF in manual detection of residual block.},

Optogenetics is currently the state-of-the-art method for causal-oriented brain research. Despite an increasingly large number of invertebrate and rodent studies showing profound electrophysiological and behavioral effects induced by optogenetics [1, 2], only two primate studies have reported modulation of local single-cell activity but with no behavioral effects [3, 4]. Here, we show that optogenetic stimulation of cortical neurons within rhesus monkey arcuate sulcus, during the execution of a visually guided saccade task, evoked significant and reproducible changes in saccade latencies as a function of target position. Moreover, using concurrent optogenetic stimulation and opto-fMRI [5, 6]), we observed optogenetically induced changes in fMRI activity in specific functional cortical networks throughout the monkey brain. This is critical information for the advancement of optogenetic primate research models and for initiating the development of optogenetically based cell-specific therapies with which to treat neurological diseases in humans.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen massive, distributed datasets become the norm in neuroimaging research, and the methodologies used analyze them have, in response, become more collaborative and exploratory. Tools and infrastructure are continuously being developed and deployed to facilitate research in this context: grid computation platforms to process the data, distributed data stores to house and share them, high-speed networks to move them around and collaborative, often web-based, platforms to provide access to and sometimes manage the entire system. BrainBrowser is a lightweight, high-performance JavaScript visualization library built to provide easy-to-use, powerful, on-demand visualization of remote datasets in this new research environment. BrainBrowser leverages modern Web technologies, such as WebGL, HTML5 and Web Workers, to visualize 3D surface and volumetric neuroimaging data in any modern web browser without requiring any browser plugins. It is thus trivial to integrate BrainBrowser into any web-based platform. BrainBrowser is simple enough to produce a basic web-based visualization in a few lines of code, while at the same time being robust enough to create full-featured visualization applications. BrainBrowser can dynamically load the data required for a given visualization, so no network bandwidth needs to be waisted on data that will not be used. BrainBrowser's integration into the standardized web platform also allows users to consider using 3D data visualization in novel ways, such as for data distribution, data sharing and dynamic online publications. BrainBrowser is already being used in two major online platforms, CBRAIN and LORIS, and has been used to make the 1TB MACACC dataset openly accessible.},

	note = {Chaotic systems perform well as a new rich source of
cryptography and pseudo-random coding. Unfortunately their digital
dynamical properties would degrade due to the finite computing
precision. Proposed in this paper is a modified digital chaotic
sequence generator based on chaotic logistic systems with a coupling
structure where one chaotic subsystem generates perturbation signals
to disturb the control parameter of the other one. The numerical
simulations show that the length of chaotic orbits, the output
distribution of chaotic system, and the security of chaotic
sequences have been greatly improved. Moreover the chaotic sequence
period can be extended at least by one order of magnitude longer
than that of the uncoupled logistic system and the difficulty in
decrypting increases 2$^{\textrm{128}}$*2$^{\textrm{128}}$ times indicating that the
dynamical degradation of digital chaos is effectively improved. A
field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of an algorithm
is given and the corresponding experiment shows that the output
speed of the generated chaotic sequences can reach 571.4{\textasciitilde}Mbps
indicating that the designed generator can be applied to the
real-time video image encryption.},

To examine the mechanisms underlying hippocampal coding, here we measured the intracellular dynamics of place cells by combining in vivo whole-cell recordings with a virtual-reality system. Head-restrained mice, running on a spherical treadmill, interacted with a computer-generated visual environment to perform spatial behaviours. Robust place-cell activity was present during movement along a virtual linear track. From whole-cell recordings, we identified three subthreshold signatures of place fields: an asymmetric ramp-like depolarization of the baseline membrane potential, an increase in the amplitude of intracellular theta oscillations, and a phase precession of the intracellular theta oscillation relative to the extracellularly recorded theta rhythm. These intracellular dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate and temporal codes. The virtual-reality system developed here will enable new experimental approaches to study the neural circuits underlying navigation.},

	abstract = {Significant resources around the world have been invested in neuroimaging studies of brain function and disease. Easier access to this large body of work should have profound impact on research in cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry, leading to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric and neurological disease. A trend toward increased sharing of neuroimaging data has emerged in recent years. Nevertheless, a number of barriers continue to impede momentum. Many researchers and institutions remain uncertain about how to share data or lack the tools and expertise to participate in data sharing. The use of electronic data capture (EDC) methods for neuroimaging greatly simplifies the task of data collection and has the potential to help standardize many aspects of data sharing. We review here the motivations for sharing neuroimaging data, the current data sharing landscape, and the sociological or technical barriers that still need to be addressed. The INCF Task Force on Neuroimaging Datasharing, in conjunction with several collaborative groups around the world, has started work on several tools to ease and eventually automate the practice of data sharing. It is hoped that such tools will allow researchers to easily share raw, processed, and derived neuroimaging data, with appropriate metadata and provenance records, and will improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging studies. By providing seamless integration of data sharing and analysis tools within a commodity research environment, the Task Force seeks to identify and minimize barriers to data sharing in the field of neuroimaging.},

	abstract = {The amino acid sequences of 25 archaeal retinal proteins from 13 different strains of extreme halophiles were analyzed to establish their molecular phylogenetic relationship. On the basis of amino acid sequence similarity, these proteins apparently formed a distinct family designated as the archaeal rhodopsin family (ARF), which was not related to other known proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors. The archaeal rhodopsin family was further divided into four clusters with different functions; H+ pump (bacteriorhodopsin), Cl− pump (halorhodopsin), and two kinds of sensor (sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin). These four rhodopsin clusters seemed to have occurred by gene duplication(s) before the generic speciation of halophilic archaea, based on phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, the degrees of differences in amino acid sequences within each cluster simply reflected the divergent evolution of halophilic archaea. By comparing the branch lengths after speciation points of the reconstituted tree, we calculated the relative evolution rates of the four archaeal rhodopsins bacteriorhodopsin:halorhodopsin:sensory rhodopsin: phoborhodopsin to be 5:4:3:10. From these values, the degrees of functional and structural restriction of each protein can be inferred. The branching topology of four clusters grouped bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin versus sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin by likelihood mapping. Using bacteriorhodopsin (and halorhodopsin) as an outgroup, the gene duplication point of sensory rhodopsin/phoborhodopsin was determined. By calculating the branch lengths between the gene duplication point and each halophilic archaea speciation point, we could speculate upon the relative evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin and pre-phoborhodopsin. The evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin was fivefold faster than that of pre-phoborhodopsin, which suggests that the original function of the ancestral sensor was similar to that of phoborhodopsin, and that sensory rhodopsin evolved from pre-sensory rhodopsin by the accumulation of mutations. The changes in evolution rate by gene duplication and functional differentiation were demonstrated in the archaeal rhodopsin family using the gene duplication date and halobacterial speciation date as common time stamps.},

	abstract = {Objective. To explore the use of classical feedback control methods to achieve an improved deep brain stimulation (DBS) algorithm for application to Parkinson's disease (PD). Approach. A computational model of PD dynamics was employed to develop model-based rational feedback controller design. The restoration of thalamocortical relay capabilities to patients suffering from PD is formulated as a feedback control problem with the DBS waveform serving as the control input. Two high-level control strategies are tested: one that is driven by an online estimate of thalamic reliability, and another that acts to eliminate substantial decreases in the inhibition from the globus pallidus interna (GPi) to the thalamus. Control laws inspired by traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) methodology are prescribed for each strategy and simulated on this computational model of the basal ganglia network. Main Results. For control based upon thalamic reliability, a strategy of frequency proportional control with proportional bias delivered the optimal control achieved for a given energy expenditure. In comparison, control based upon synaptic inhibitory output from the GPi performed very well in comparison with those of reliability-based control, with considerable further reduction in energy expenditure relative to that of open-loop DBS. The best controller performance was amplitude proportional with derivative control and integral bias, which is full PID control. We demonstrated how optimizing the three components of PID control is feasible in this setting, although the complexity of these optimization functions argues for adaptive methods in implementation. Significance. Our findings point to the potential value of model-based rational design of feedback controllers for Parkinson's disease.},

This review addresses conscious error perception (“error awareness”) in healthy subjects as well as the relationship between error awareness and neurological and psychiatric diseases. We first discuss the main findings on error awareness in healthy subjects. A brain region, that appears consistently involved in error awareness processes, is the insula, which also provides a link to the clinical conditions reviewed here. Then we focus on a neurological condition whose core element is an impaired awareness for neurological consequences of a disease: anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP). The insular cortex has been implicated in both error awareness and AHP, with anterior insular regions being involved in conscious error processing and more posterior areas being related to AHP. In addition to cytoarchitectonic and connectivity data, this reflects a functional and structural gradient within the insula from anterior to posterior. Furthermore, studies dealing with error awareness and lack of insight in a number of psychiatric diseases are reported. Especially in schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) the performance monitoring system seems impaired, thus conscious error perception might be altered.},

Here we provide a new design of a versatile reusable hybrid infusion-recording (HIME) system which can be utilized in freely moving mice performing cognitive tasks. The HIME system allows monitoring neuronal activity in multiple layers in several brain structures. Here, we provide examples of bilateral injection and recordings of full spectrum of learning and memory related oscillations, i.e., theta (4–12 Hz), gamma (40–100) and ripple activity (130–150 Hz), in five hippocampal layers as well as in the CA1 and CA2 regions. Furthermore, the system is designed to be used for parallel recordings in the amygdala, cortex and other brain areas, before and after infusion of reagents of interest, either in or off a cognitive test. We anticipate that the HIME system can be particularly convenient to advance functional neuroglycobiological studies and molecular deciphering of mechanisms governing long-term memory consolidation.},

Our goal is to use the preamplifier in a fully integrated, multi-channel, bi-directional neuro-electronic interface.
Among others, two main requirements must be addressed when designing such kind of integrated recording systems: noise performance and very low frequency disturbance rejection. These two requirements need to be satisfied together with a small silicon area design, to be able to integrate a large number of recording channels (i.e. up to thousands) onto a single die. A prototype preamplifier circuit has been designed and implemented; in this paper we report the experimental results.
While satisfying the above requirements, our circuit offers state-of-the-art smallest area occupation (0.13 mm2) and consumes 4.5 [mu]W. Sub-threshold-biased lateral pnp transistors, used to implement very high resistance value integrated resistors, have been characterized to determine the resistance spread.
The fabricated prototype, coupled with a commercial Micro-Electrode Array (MEA), has been successfully employed to record the extracellular electrophysiological spontaneous activity, both of muscular cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes) and of spinal cord neurons from murines.},

	abstract = {Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) is a non invasive technique allowing the recovery of hemodynamic changes in the brain. Due to the diffusive nature of photon propagation in turbid media and the fact that cerebral tissues are located around 1.5 cm under the adult human scalp, DOI measurements are subject to partial volume errors. DOI measurements are also sensitive to large pial vessels because oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin are the dominant chromophores in the near infrared window. In this study, the effect of the extra-cerebral vasculature in proximity of the sagittal sinus was investigated for its impact on DOI measurements simulated over the human adult visual cortex. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two specific models of the human head derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The first model included the extra-cerebral vasculature in which constant hemoglobin concentrations were assumed while the second did not. The screening effect of the vasculature was quantified by comparing recovered hemoglobin changes from each model for different optical arrays and regions of activation. A correction factor accounting for the difference between the recovered and the simulated hemoglobin changes was computed in each case. The results show that changes in hemoglobin concentration are better estimated when the extra-cerebral vasculature is modeled and the correction factors obtained in this case were at least 1.4-fold lower. The effect of the vasculature was also examined in a high-density diffuse optical tomography configuration. In this case, the difference between changes in hemoglobin concentration recovered with each model was reduced down to 10\%.},

	abstract = {To learn and mimic how the brain processes information has been a major research challenge for decades. Despite the efforts, little is known on how we encode, maintain and retrieve information. One of the hypothesis assumes that transient states are generated in our intricate network of neurons when the brain is stimulated by a sensory input. Based on this idea, powerful computational schemes have been developed. These schemes, known as machine-learning techniques, include artificial neural networks, support vector machine and reservoir computing, among others. In this paper, we concentrate on the reservoir computing (RC) technique using delay-coupled systems. Unlike traditional RC, where the information is processed in large recurrent networks of interconnected artificial neurons, we choose a minimal design, implemented via a simple nonlinear dynamical system subject to a self-feedback loop with delay. This design is not intended to represent an actual brain circuit, but aims at finding the minimum ingredients that allow developing an efficient information processor. This simple scheme not only allows us to address fundamental questions but also permits simple hardware implementations. By reducing the neuro-inspired reservoir computing approach to its bare essentials, we find that nonlinear transient responses of the simple dynamical system enable the processing of information with excellent performance and at unprecedented speed. We specifically explore different hardware implementations and, by that, we learn about the role of nonlinearity, noise, system responses, connectivity structure, and the quality of projection onto the required high-dimensional state space. Besides the relevance for the understanding of basic mechanisms, this scheme opens direct technological opportunities that could not be addressed with previous approaches.},

In this work we numerically model the utility of signals from a small 6-optode time-resolved diffuse optical tomographic apparatus for inferring baseline scattering and absorption coefficients of the scalp, skull and brain, when complete geometric information is available from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We use an optical model where MRI-segmented tissues are assumed homogeneous. We introduce a noise model capturing both photon shot noise and forward model numerical accuracy, and use Bayesian inference to predict errorbars and correlations on the measurments. We also sample from the full posterior distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We conclude that {\textasciitilde} 106 detected photons are sufficient to measure the brain's scattering and absorption to a few percent. We present preliminary results using a fast multi-layer slab model, comparing the case when layer thicknesses are known versus unknown.},

	abstract = {The neural circuits underlying emotional valence and motivated behaviors are several synapses away from both defined sensory inputs and quantifiable motor outputs. Electrophysiology has provided us with a suitable means for observing neural activity during behavior, but methods for controlling activity for the purpose of studying motivated behaviors have been inadequate: electrical stimulation lacks cellular specificity and pharmacological manipulation lacks temporal resolution. The recent emergence of optogenetic tools provides a new means for establishing causal relationships between neural activity and behavior. Optogenetics, the use of genetically-encodable light-activated proteins, permits the modulation of specific neural circuit elements with millisecond precision. The ability to control individual cell types, and even projections between distal regions, allows us to investigate functional connectivity in a causal manner. The greatest consequence of controlling neural activity with finer precision has been the characterization of individual neural circuits within anatomical brain regions as defined functional units. Within the mesolimbic dopamine system, optogenetics has helped separate subsets of dopamine neurons with distinct functions for reward, aversion and salience processing, elucidated GABA neuronal effects on behavior, and characterized connectivity with forebrain and cortical structures. Within the striatum, optogenetics has confirmed the opposing relationship between direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs), in addition to characterizing the inhibition of MSNs by cholinergic interneurons. Within the hypothalamus, optogenetics has helped overcome the heterogeneity in neuronal cell-type and revealed distinct circuits mediating aggression and feeding. Within the amygdala, optogenetics has allowed the study of intra-amygdala microcircuitry as well as interconnections with distal regions involved in fear and anxiety. In this review, we will present the body of optogenetic studies that has significantly enhanced our understanding of emotional valence and motivated behaviors.

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a variety of motor signs affecting gait, postural stability, and tremor. These symptoms can be improved when electrodes are implanted in deep brain structures and electrical stimulation is delivered chronically at high frequency ({\textgreater}100 Hz). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) onset or cessation affects PD signs with different latencies, and the long-term improvements of symptoms affecting the body axis and those affecting the limbs vary in duration. Interestingly, these effects have not been systematically analyzed and modeled. We compare these timing phenomena in relation to one axial (i.e., locomotion) and one distal (i.e., tremor) signs. We suggest that during DBS, these symptoms are improved by different network mechanisms operating at multiple time scales. Locomotion improvement may involve a delayed plastic reorganization, which takes hours to develop, whereas rest tremor is probably alleviated by an almost instantaneous desynchronization of neural activity in subcortical structures. Even if all PD patients develop both distal and axial symptoms sooner or later, current computational models of locomotion and rest tremor are separate. Furthermore, a few computational models of locomotion focus on PD and none exploring the effect of DBS was found in the literature. We, therefore, discuss a model of a neuronal network during DBS, general enough to explore the subcircuits controlling locomotion and rest tremor simultaneously. This model accounts for synchronization and plasticity, two mechanisms that are believed to underlie the two types of symptoms analyzed. We suggest that a hysteretic effect caused by DBS-induced plasticity and synchronization modulation contributes to the different therapeutic latencies observed. Such a comprehensive, generic computational model of DBS effects, incorporating these timing phenomena, should assist in developing a more efficient, faster, durable treatment of distal and axial signs in PD.},

Some of them represent membrane ion transport proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump, or channelrhodopsin-1 (ChR1), a recently identified light-gated proton channel from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. ChR1 and ChR2, a related microbial-type rhodopsin from C. reinhardtii, were shown to be involved in generation of photocurrents of this green alga. We demonstrate by functional expression, both in oocytes of Xenopus laevis and mammalian cells, that ChR2 is a directly light-switched cation-selective ion channel. This channel opens rapidly after absorption of a photon to generate a large permeability for monovalent and divalent cations. ChR2 desensitizes in continuous light to a smaller steady-state conductance. Recovery from desensitization is accelerated by extracellular H+ and negative membrane potential, whereas closing of the ChR2 ion channel is decelerated by intracellular H+. ChR2 is expressed mainly in C. reinhardtii under low-light conditions, suggesting involvement in photoreception in dark-adapted cells. The predicted seven-transmembrane α helices of ChR2 are characteristic for G protein-coupled receptors but reflect a different motif for a cation-selective ion channel. Finally, we demonstrate that ChR2 may be used to depolarize small or large cells, simply by illumination.},

At these geometries it is able to perform bright-field, fluorescence and qualitative ellipsometric imaging. It is the first single instrument in the literature to be able to perform all of these functionalities. The system can be assembled by two undergraduate students from a provided manual in less than a day, from off-the-shelf and 3D printed components, which together cost approximately \$16k at 2016 market prices. We include a highly specified assembly manual, a summary of design methodologies, and all associated 3D-printing files in hopes that the utility of the design outlives the current component market. This open design approach prepares readers to customize the instrument to specific needs and applications. We also discuss how to select household LEDs as low-cost light sources for fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate the utility of the microscope in varied geometries and functionalities, with particular emphasis on studying hydrated, solid-supported lipid films and wet biological samples.},

Eighteen dancers recorded their menstrual periods, work shifts, and tip earnings for 60 days on a study web site. A mixed-model analysis of 296 work shifts (representing about 5300 lap dances) showed an interaction between cycle phase and hormonal contraception use. Normally cycling participants earned about US\$335 per 5-h shift during estrus, US\$260 per shift during the luteal phase, and US\$185 per shift during menstruation. By contrast, participants using contraceptive pills showed no estrous earnings peak. These results constitute the first direct economic evidence for the existence and importance of estrus in contemporary human females, in a real-world work setting. These results have clear implications for human evolution, sexuality, and economics.},

Mathematical expressions, based on random walk analysis of light propagation within tissue slabs, are used to relate the diffuse reflection and transmittance to the absorption coefficient, mu a, and effective scattering coefficient, mu's, for samples of myocardial tissue which were subjected to rapid step changes in temperature. Time-dependent changes in mu's, indicate two processes, one with a fast and temperature-dependent rate the other with a slow and apparently temperature-independent rate. For final temperatures above 56.8 degrees C and for the first 500 s after the temperature change, the optical parameters are well fit by exponential forms that exhibit temperature-dependent time constants as predicted by Arrhenius reaction rate theory of thermal damage. The scattering changes are associated with an apparent activation energy, delta E, of 162 kJ/mole and a frequency constant, A, of 3 x 10(23) s-1.

During this procedure, it has been observed that high-frequency (100 Hz) stimulation of VIM was able to stop the extrapyramidal tremor. In patients with bilateral tremor of extrapyramidal origin, who were resistant to drug therapy, the therapeutic protocol associated (1) a radiofrequency VIM thalamotomy for the most disabled side, and (2) a continuous VIM stimulation for the other side using stereotactically implanted electrodes, connected to subcutaneous stimulators. VIM thalamotomy relieved the tremor in all operated cases. Side effects were mild and regressive. VIM stimulation strongly decreased the tremor but failed to suppress it as completely as thalamotomy did. This was due in part to the fact that programmable stimulator frequency rate is limited to 130 Hz, while it appeared that the optimal stimulation frequency was 200 Hz. This therapeutic protocol appears to be of interest for patients with bilateral extrapyramidal movement disorders.},

Electrical recordings from motor nerves in the tail are decoded into intended forward swims and turns, which are used to update a virtual environment displayed underneath the fish. Several behavioral features—such as turning responses to whole-field motion and dark avoidance—are well-replicated in this virtual setting. We readily observed neuronal populations in the hindbrain with laterally selective responses that correlated with right or left optomotor behavior. We also observed neurons in the habenula, pallium, and midbrain with response properties specific to environmental features. Beyond single-cell correlations, the classification of network activity in such virtual settings promises to reveal principles of brainwide neural dynamics during behavior.},

	abstract = {Bio-inspired asynchronous event-based vision sensors are currently introducing a paradigm shift in visual information processing. These new sensors rely on a stimulus-driven principle of light acquisition similar to biological retinas. They are event-driven and fully asynchronous, thereby reducing redundancy and encoding exact times of input signal changes, leading to a very precise temporal resolution. Approaches for higher-level computer vision often rely on the realiable detection of features in visual frames, but similar definitions of features for the novel dynamic and event-based visual input representation of silicon retinas have so far been lacking. This article addresses the problem of learning and recognizing features for event-based vision sensors, which capture properties of truly spatiotemporal volumes of sparse visual event information. A novel computational architecture for learning and encoding spatiotemporal features is introduced based on a set of predictive recurrent reservoir networks, competing via winner-take-all selection. Features are learned in an unsupervised manner from real-world input recorded with event-based vision sensors. It is shown that the networks in the architecture learn distinct and task-specific dynamic visual features, and can predict their trajectories over time.},

	abstract = {Motivated by experiments employing optogenetic stimulation of cortical regions, we consider spike control strategies for ensembles of uncoupled integrate and fire neurons with a common conductance input. We construct strategies for control of spike patterns, that is, multineuron trains of action potentials, up to some maximal spike rate determined by the neural biophysics. We emphasize a constructive role for parameter heterogeneity, and find a simple rule for controllability in pairs of neurons. In particular, we determine parameters for which common drive is not limited to inducing synchronous spiking. For large ensembles, we determine how the number of controllable neurons varies with the number of observed (recorded) neurons, and what collateral spiking occurs in the full ensemble during control of the subensemble. While complete control of spiking in every neuron is not possible with a single input, we find that a degree of subensemble control is made possible by exploiting dynamical heterogeneity. As most available technologies for neural stimulation are underactuated, in the sense that the number of target neurons far exceeds the number of independent channels of stimulation, these results suggest partial control strategies that may be important in the development of sensory neuroprosthetics and other neurocontrol applications.},

This synchrony preferentially occurs over 10–30 Hz, the so-called beta band. Correlative evidence has been supplemented by experiments in which direct stimulation of the basal ganglia in the beta band slows movement. Yet questions remain regarding the small scale of the latter effects and whether synchrony is an early or even obligatory feature of parkinsonism. Nevertheless, the principle that abnormally synchronised activity in the beta band can disrupt the function finds a precedent in the syndrome of cortical myoclonus. Here, pathologically synchronised discharges of pyramidal neurons are transmitted to the healthy spinal cord. The result is the synchronous discharge of motor units leading to rhythmic jerking.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. Several toxin-induced animals models simulate the motor deficits occurring in PD. Among them, the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model is frequently used in rats and has the advantage of presenting side-biased motor impairments. However, the behavioral consequences of a unilateral 6-OHDA-lesion have, so far, not been described in detail in mice. The aim of this study was to characterize mice with unilateral 6-OHDA-lesions placed in the median forebrain bundle using several motor behavioral tests in order to identify the most suitable predictor of nigral cell loss. Mice underwent various drug-induced (amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotation) and spontaneous motor tests (cylinder, rotarod, elevated body swing, and stride length test). The amphetamine-induced rotation test, the cylinder and the rotarod test were most sensitive and reliable in detecting loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra. This study demonstrates that substantial and stable unilateral 6-OHDA-induced lesions can be established in mice, and that these lesions can be functionally assessed using several different side-bias-based behavioral tests. This mouse model offers the opportunity to use transgenic mouse strains and study the interactions between genes of interest and toxins in relation to Parkinson's disease etiology in the future.},

Regulatory compliance requirements make de-ploying new full image compression techniques difficult. Instead of forcing applications and end users to deal with the deployment complexity, we show that image data can be effectively and transparently compressed by the storage infrastructure. We analyzed our MICA compressor performance using five million publicly available medical images ({\textgreater} 2.2 TB) in three different image formats from eight sources. With 8KB blocks, we achieved 13\% better compression, 10\% better compression throughput and 782\% better uncompression throughput than JPEG-LS. MICA also offered some compression for non-medical data that was incidentally stored in the same storage system.},

    A 2-day consensus conference was held to examine scientific and ethical issues in the application of deep brain stimulation for treating mood and behavioral disorders, such as major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome.Objectives  
    The primary objectives of the conference were to (1) establish consensus among participants about the design of future clinical trials of deep brain stimulation for disorders of mood, behavior, and thought and (2) develop standards for the protection of human subjects participating in such studies.Results  
    Conference participants identified 16 key points for guiding research in this growing field.Conclusions  
    The adoption of the described guidelines would help to protect the safety and rights of research subjects who participate in clinical trials of deep brain stimulation for disorders of mood, behavior, and thought and have further potential to benefit other stakeholders in the research process, including clinical researchers and device manufactures. That said, the adoption of the guidelines will require broad and substantial commitment from many of these same stakeholders.},

However, this requires compact wearable instruments that do not inhibit natural movements. Application of optical potentiometry with voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye using an implantable image sensor is also useful. However, the increasing number of leads required for the multiple wired sensors to measure larger domains inhibits natural behavior. For imaging broad areas by numerous sensors without excessive wiring, a web-like sensor that can wrap the brain was developed. Kaleidoscopic potentiometry is possible using the imaging system with concatenated sensors by changing the alignment of the sensors. This paper describes organization of the system, evaluation of the system by a fluorescence imaging, and finally, functional brain fluorescence plurimetry by the sensor. The recorded data in rat somatosensory cortex using the developed multiple-area imaging system compared well with electrophysiology results.},

	abstract = {Studying brain function and its local circuit dynamics requires neural interfaces that can record and stimulate the brain with high spatiotemporal resolution. Optogenetics, a technique that genetically targets specific neurons to express light-sensitive channel proteins, provides the capability to control central nervous system neuronal activity in mammals with millisecond time precision. This technique enables precise optical stimulation of neurons and simultaneous monitoring of neural response by electrophysiological means, both in the vicinity of and distant to the stimulation site. We previously demonstrated, in vitro, the dual capability (optical delivery and electrical recording) while testing a novel hybrid device (optrode-MEA), which incorporates a tapered coaxial optical electrode (optrode) and a 100 element microelectrode array (MEA). Here we report a fully chronic implant of a new version of this device in ChR2-expressing rats, and demonstrate its use in freely moving animals over periods up to 8 months. In its present configuration, we show the device delivering optical excitation to a single cortical site while mapping the neural response from the surrounding 30 channels of the 6 × 6 element MEA, thereby enabling recording of optically modulated single-unit and local field potential activity across several millimeters of the neocortical landscape.},

	abstract = {Since the 1960s, deep brain stimulation and spinal cord stimulation at low frequency (30 Hz) have been used to treat intractable pain of various origins. For this purpose, specific hardware have been designed, including deep brain electrodes, extensions, and implantable programmable generators (IPGs). In the meantime, movement disorders, and particularly parkinsonian and essential tremors, were treated by electrolytic or mechanic lesions in various targets of the basal ganglia, particularly in the thalamus and in the internal pallidum. The advent in the 1960s of levodopa, as well as the side effects and complications of ablative surgery (e.g., thalamotomy and pallidotomy), has sent functional neurosurgery of movement disorders to oblivion. In 1987, the serendipitous discovery of the effect of high-frequency stimulation (HFS), mimicking lesions, allowed the revival of the surgery of movement disorders by stimulation of the thalamus, which treated tremors with limited morbidity, and adaptable and reversible results. The stability along time of these effects allowed extending it to new targets suggested by basic research in monkeys. The HFS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has profoundly challenged the practice of functional surgery as the effect on the triad of dopaminergic symptoms was very significant, allowing to decrease the drug dosage and therefore a decrease of their complications, the levodopa-induced dyskinesias. In the meantime, based on the results of previous basic research in various fields, HFS has been progressively extended to potentially treat epilepsy and, more recently, psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorders, Gilles de la Tourette tics, and severe depression. Similarly, suggested by the observation of changes in PET scan, applications have been extended to cluster headaches by stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus and even more recently, to obesity and drug addiction. In the field of movement disorders, it has become clear that STN stimulation is not efficient on the nondopaminergic symptoms such as freezing of gait. Based on experimental data obtained in MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys, the pedunculopontine nucleus has been used as a new target, and as suggested by the animal research results, its use indeed improves walking and stability when stimulation is performed at low frequency (25 Hz). The concept of simultaneous stimulation of multiple targets eventually at low or high frequency, and that of several electrodes in one target, is being accepted to increase the efficiency. This leads to and is being facilitated by the development of new hardware (multiple-channel IPGs, specific electrodes, rechargeable batteries). Still additional efforts are needed at the level of the stimulation paradigm and in the waveform. The recent development of nanotechnologies allows the design of totally new systems expanding the field of deep brain stimulation. These new techniques will make it possible to not only inhibit or excite deep brain structures to alleviate abnormal symptoms but also open the field for the use of recording cortical activities to drive neuroprostheses through brain-computer interfaces. The new field of compensation of deficits will then become part of the field of functional neurosurgery.},

	abstract = {Objective. Inferring the times of sequences of action potentials (APs) (spike trains) from neurophysiological data is a key problem in computational neuroscience. The detection of APs from two-photon imaging of calcium signals offers certain advantages over traditional electrophysiological approaches, as up to thousands of spatially and immunohistochemically defined neurons can be recorded simultaneously. However, due to noise, dye buffering and the limited sampling rates in common microscopy configurations, accurate detection of APs from calcium time series has proved to be a difficult problem. Approach. Here we introduce a novel approach to the problem making use of finite rate of innovation (FRI) theory (Vetterli et al 2002 IEEE Trans. Signal Process. 50 1417–28). For calcium transients well fit by a single exponential, the problem is reduced to reconstructing a stream of decaying exponentials. Signals made of a combination of exponentially decaying functions with different onset times are a subclass of FRI signals, for which much theory has recently been developed by the signal processing community. Main results. We demonstrate for the first time the use of FRI theory to retrieve the timing of APs from calcium transient time series. The final algorithm is fast, non-iterative and parallelizable. Spike inference can be performed in real-time for a population of neurons and does not require any training phase or learning to initialize parameters. Significance. The algorithm has been tested with both real data (obtained by simultaneous electrophysiology and multiphoton imaging of calcium signals in cerebellar Purkinje cell dendrites), and surrogate data, and outperforms several recently proposed methods for spike train inference from calcium imaging data.},

The local field potential (LFP) reflects activity of many neurons in the vicinity of the recording electrode and is therefore useful for studying local network dynamics. Much of the nature of the LFP is, however, still unknown. There are, for instance, contradicting reports on the spatial extent of the region generating the LFP. Here, we use a detailed biophysical modeling approach to investigate the size of the contributing region by simulating the LFP from a large number of neurons around the electrode. We find that the size of the generating region depends on the neuron morphology, the synapse distribution, and the correlation in synaptic activity. For uncorrelated activity, the LFP represents cells in a small region (within a radius of a few hundred micrometers). If the LFP contributions from different cells are correlated, the size of the generating region is determined by the spatial extent of the correlated activity.},

Interrogation of even deep neural circuits can be conducted by directly probing the necessity and sufficiency of defined circuit elements with millisecond-scale, cell type-specific optical perturbations, coupled with suitable readouts such as electrophysiology, optical circuit dynamics measures and freely moving behavior in mammals. Here we collect in detail our strategies for delivering microbial opsin genes to deep mammalian brain structures in vivo, along with protocols for integrating the resulting optical control with compatible readouts (electrophysiological, optical and behavioral). The procedures described here, from initial virus preparation to systems-level functional readout, can be completed within 4–5 weeks. Together, these methods may help in providing circuit-level insight into the dynamics underlying complex mammalian behaviors in health and disease.},

Accordingly, the federal government and the states have enacted laws that permit law enforcement to identify offenders and to apply various levels of sanctions. There is no constitutional requirement that evidence of drunkenness be permitted in defense of criminal behavior. In practice, citizens who undertake to operate motor vehicles under the influence of alcohol are considered reckless per se and have no right to obstruct law enforcement in determining their condition. Indeed, refusal of roadside sobriety tests, including the Breathalyzer, may be considered a separate offense. The issuing of Miranda-type warnings by police officers has been ruled on recently in New Jersey. In a superior court appellate decision, State v. Spell, the court outlined the necessary procedures, concluding that, although motorists have no right to refuse testing, police officers have an obligation to issue sufficient warnings before the motorist decides how to proceed. In the Spell matter, the defendant incriminated himself by refusing the testing, even though he was acquitted on the drunk-driving charge. The authors discuss the role of expert testimony in these matters.},

Experimental binges provide a valid model for examining aspects of the gradual progression from drug use to abuse, particularly when attempting to identify environmental and genetic factors that may prompt intermittent behavioral routines to become dysregulated, as exemplified during cycles of bingeing. Here we explore binge behavior in animals with a particular focus on data obtained from self-administration studies that utilize conditions that allow for both unrestricted and prolonged access to cocaine, opiates, alcohol or food. Many behavioral and neural effects of bingeing are shared between these substances, indicating that the repetitive nature of binge behavior for many types of drug abuse may be related to the dysregulation of common neural circuits. Interestingly, intense bingeing occurs with the emergence of two potential changes in behavior; an increase in the rate or an increase in the persistence of behavioral responding. These two changes indicate that control over bingeing may be determined by a number of processes, including sensitization, tolerance, and withdrawal.},

Behavioral data analysis revealed a less risky, more careful choice behavior under active DBS compared to DBS switched off. PET showed win- and loss-related activations in the paracingulate cortex, temporal poles, precuneus and hippocampus under active DBS, brain areas that have been implicated in action monitoring and behavioral control.

	abstract = {Neural engineering, itself an 'emerging interdisciplinary research area' [1] has undergone a sea change over the past few years with the emergence of exciting new optical technologies for monitoring, stimulating, inhibiting and, more generally, modulating neural activity. To a large extent, this change is driven by the realization of the promise and complementary strengths that emerging photo-stimulation tools offer to add to the neural engineer's toolbox, which has been almost exclusively based on electrical stimulation technologies. Notably, photo-stimulation is non-contact, can in some cases be genetically targeted to specific cell populations, can achieve high spatial specificity (cellular or even sub-cellular) in two or three dimensions, and opens up the possibility of large-scale spatial–temporal patterned stimulation. It also offers a seamless solution to the problem of cross-talk generated by simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording. As in other biomedical optics phenomena [2], photo-stimulation includes multiple possible modes of interaction between light and the target neurons, including a variety of photo-physical and photo-bio–chemical effects with various intrinsic components or exogenous 'sensitizers' which can be loaded into the tissue or genetically expressed. Early isolated reports of neural excitation with light date back to the late 19th century [3] and to Arvanitaki and Chalazonitis' work five decades ago [4]; however, the mechanism by which these and other direct photo-stimulation, inhibition and modulation events [5–7] took place is yet unclear, as is their short- and long-term safety profile. Photo-chemical photolysis of covalently 'caged' neurotransmitters [8, 9] has been widely used in cellular neuroscience research for three decades, including for exciting or inhibiting neural activity, and for mapping neural circuits. Technological developments now allow neurotransmitters to be uncaged with exquisite spatial specificity (down to a single spine, with two-photon uncaging) and in rapid, flexible spatial–temporal patterns [10–14]. Nevertheless, current technology generally requires damaging doses of UV or violet illumination and the continuous re-introduction of the caged compound, which, despite interest, makes for a difficult transition beyond in vitro preparations. Thus, the tremendous progress in the in vivo application of photo-stimulation tools over the past five years has been largely facilitated by two 'exciting' new photo-stimulation technologies: photo-biological stimulation of a rapidly increasing arsenal of light-sensitive ion channels and pumps ('optogenetic' probes[15–18]) and direct photo-thermal stimulation of neural tissue with an IR laser [19–21]. The Journal of Neural Engineering has dedicated a special section in this issue to highlight advances in optical stimulation technology, which includes original peer-reviewed contributions dealing with the design of modern optical systems for spatial–temporal control of optical excitation patterns and with the biophysics of neural–thermal interaction mediated by electromagnetic waves. The paper by Nikolenko, Peterka and Yuste [22] presents a compact design of a microscope-photo-stimulator based on a transmissive phase-modulating spatial-light modulator (SLM). Computer-generated holographic photo-stimulation using SLMs [12–14, 23] allows the efficient parallel projection of intense sparse patterns of light, and the welcome development of compact, user-friendly systems will likely reduce the barrier to its widespread adoption. The paper by Losavio et al [24] presents the design and functional characteristics of their acousto-optical deflector (AOD) systems for studying spatial–temporal dendritic integration in single neurons in vitro. Both single-photon (UV) and two-photon (femtosecond pulsed IR) AOD uncaging systems are described in detail. The paper presents an excellent overview of the current state of the art and limitations of this technology, which is increasingly being applied for both photo- stimulation and imaging [25, 26]. Finally, the paper by Pikov et al [27] studies the modulatory biophysical effects exerted by low power millimeter waves on neuronal excitability and membrane properties of cortical pyramidal neurons in vitro. These extensive neuro-modulatory effects seem to include a thermal component (related to the photo-thermal effects observed under laser illumination [28]) as well as a more specific effect exerted by these lower frequency (sub-THz) electromagnetic waves. These new contributions augment five previous manuscripts published by the journal on optical stimulation technology, which reported the development of a fiber-based system for in vivo optogenetic cortical stimulation [29], patterned stimulation systems based on computer-generated holography [23] and on arrays of micro-LEDs [30] designed for an optical retina neuroprosthetic [31], and an integrated system for optical stimulation with microelectrode array recording [32]. Without doubt, many more will quickly follow as neural engineers and neuroscientists increasingly tackle the many challenges that this exciting area poses. We can all expect to hear much more in the near future about the biophysics and implementation of photo-physical neural-interaction mechanisms, the design of new optogenetic probes and patterned-stimulation systems (including stand-alone and implantable systems), further integration of electrodes and optical components into electro-optical neurostimulation systems, and rapid progress towards multiple medical applications for alleviating neurological disabilities and improving human health.

Yet the lack of a general approach to rapidly construct such networks remains a major challenge for 3D tissue culture. Here, we printed rigid 3D filament networks of carbohydrate glass, and used them as a cytocompatible sacrificial template in engineered tissues containing living cells to generate cylindrical networks that could be lined with endothelial cells and perfused with blood under high-pressure pulsatile flow. Because this simple vascular casting approach allows independent control of network geometry, endothelialization and extravascular tissue, it is compatible with a wide variety of cell types, synthetic and natural extracellular matrices, and crosslinking strategies. We also demonstrated that the perfused vascular channels sustained the metabolic function of primary rat hepatocytes in engineered tissue constructs that otherwise exhibited suppressed function in their core.},

DBS is now being extended to treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, obsessive–compulsive disorder, depression and addiction. In this review, we discuss the concept that dysfunction of motor, limbic and associative cortico-basal ganglia–thalamocortical loops underlies these various disorders, which might now be amenable to DBS treatment.},

For example, early detection of an epileptic seizure from sequential electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements would allow timely administration of anticonvulsant drugs or neurostimulation, thus reducing physical impairment and risks of overtreatment. We develop a Bayesian paradigm for state transition detection that combines optimal control and Markov processes. We define a hidden Markov model of the state evolution and develop a detection policy that minimizes a loss function of both probability of false positives and accuracy (i.e., lag between estimated and actual transition time). Our strategy automatically adapts to each newly acquired measurement based on the state evolution model and the relative loss for false positives and accuracy, thus resulting in a time varying threshold policy. The paradigm was used in two applications: 1) detection of movement onset (behavioral state) from subthalamic single unit recordings in Parkinson's disease patients performing a motor task; 2) early detection of an approaching seizure (clinical state) from multichannel intracranial EEG recordings in rodents treated with pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant. Our paradigm performs significantly better than chance and improves over widely used detection algorithms.},

To date, the preferred approach to this task largely relies on electrode array implants. We are currently pursuing two alternative methods for light-based direct activation of the RGCs. The first method is based on applying caged glutamate over the retina and uncaging it locally to obtain RGC excitation. The second method is to artificially cause RGCs to express Channelrhodopsin II (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel. In addition to being non-contact, optical techniques lend themselves relatively easily to a variety of technologies for achieving patterned stimulation with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using the Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing (DLP - DMD) technology, we have developed an optical stimulation system capable of controlled, large-scale, flexible stimulation of the retinal tissue with high temporal accuracy. In preliminary studies, we are performing patterned photo-stimulation experiments using samples of caged fluorescent probes and in rat retinas that were virally transfected with ChR2.},

The extent to which single neurons actually change remains largely unstudied, however. To evaluate how functional properties of single neurons change over time, we devised a way to perform in vivo time-lapse electrophysiological recordings from the exact same neuron. We monitored the contralateral and ipsilateral sensory-evoked spiking activity of individual L2/3 neurons from the somatosensory cortex of mice. At the end of the first recording session, we electroporated the neuron with a DNA plasmid to drive GFP expression. Then, 2 wk later, we visually guided a recording electrode in vivo to the GFP-expressing neuron for the second time. We found that contralateral and ipsilateral evoked responses (i.e., probability to respond, latency, and preference), and spontaneous activity of individual L2/3 pyramidal neurons are stable under control conditions, but that this stability could be rapidly disrupted. Contralateral whisker deprivation induced robust changes in sensory-evoked response profiles of single neurons. Our experiments provide a framework for studying the stability and plasticity of single neurons over long time scales using electrophysiology.},

	abstract = {Background
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is routinely used as a treatment for treatment-refractory Parkinson's disease and has recently been proposed for psychiatric disorders such as Tourette syndrome (TS), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Although cognitive deterioration has repeatedly been shown in patients with Parkinson's disease following DBS, the impact of DBS on cognitive functioning in psychiatric patients has not yet been reviewed.
Objective
Reviewing the available literature on cognitive functioning following DBS in psychiatric patients.
Methods
A systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science, last updated in September 2012, found 1470 papers. Abstracts were scrutinized and 26 studies examining cognitive functioning of psychiatric patients following DBS were included on basis of predetermined inclusion criteria.
Results
Twenty-six studies reported cognitive functioning of 130 psychiatric patients following DBS (37 TS patients, 56 OCD patients, 28 MDD patients, 6 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 3 patients with other disorders). None of the studies reported substantial cognitive decline following DBS. On the contrary, 13 studies reported cognitive improvement following DBS.
Conclusion
Preliminary results suggest that DBS in psychiatric disorders does not lead to cognitive decline. In selected cases cognitive functioning was improved following DBS. However, cognitive improvement cannot be conclusively attributed to DBS since studies are hampered by serious limitations. We discuss the outcomes in light of these limitations and offer suggestions for future work.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer incidence suggests a lifestyle cause. A lifestyle factor used near the breast is the application of antiperspirants/deodorants accompanied by axillary shaving. A previous study did not support a link with breast cancer. If these habits have a role in breast cancer development, women using antiperspirants/deodorants and shaving their underarms frequently would be expected to have an earlier age of diagnosis than those doing so less often. An earlier age of diagnosis would also be expected in those starting to use deodorants and shaving at an earlier age. This is the first study to investigate the intensity of underarm exposure in a cohort of breast cancer survivors. Four hundred and thirty-seven females diagnosed with breast cancer were surveyed. Once grouped by their frequency of underarm hygiene habits, the mean age of diagnosis was the primary end point. Secondary end points included the overall frequency of these habits, and potential usage group confounding variables were evaluated. All statistical tests were two-sided. Frequency and earlier onset of antiperspirant/deodorant usage with underarm shaving were associated with an earlier age of breast cancer diagnosis. Combined habits are likely for this earlier age of diagnosis. In conclusion, underarm shaving with antiperspirant/deodorant use may play a role in breast cancer. It is not clear which of these components are involved. Reviewed literature insinuates absorption of aluminium salts facilitated by dermal barrier disruption. Case-controlled investigations are needed before alternative underarm hygiene habits are suggested.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing a map of neuronal connectivity is a critical challenge in contemporary neuroscience. Recent advances in high-throughput serial section electron microscopy (EM) have produced massive 3D image volumes of nanoscale brain tissue for the first time. The resolution of EM allows for individual neurons and their synaptic connections to be directly observed. Recovering neuronal networks by manually tracing each neuronal process at this scale is unmanageable, and therefore researchers are developing automated image processing modules. Thus far, state-of-the-art algorithms focus only on the solution to a particular task (e.g., neuron segmentation or synapse identification). In this manuscript we present the first fully-automated images-to-graphs pipeline (i.e., a pipeline that begins with an imaged volume of neural tissue and produces a brain graph without any human interaction). To evaluate overall performance and select the best parameters and methods, we also develop a metric to assess the quality of the output graphs. We evaluate a set of algorithms and parameters, searching possible operating points to identify the best available brain graph for our assessment metric. Finally, we deploy a reference end-to-end version of the pipeline on a large, publicly available data set. This provides a baseline result and framework for community analysis and future algorithm development and testing. All code and data derivatives have been made publicly available in support of eventually unlocking new biofidelic computational primitives and understanding of neuropathologies.},

Here we report the use of bulk-loading of fluorescent calcium indicators to record from axons, dendrites, and neuronal cell bodies in cerebellar cortex in vivo. In cerebellar folium crus IIa of anesthetized rats, we imaged the labeled molecular layer and identified all major cellular structures: Purkinje cells, interneurons, parallel fibers, and Bergmann glia. Using extracellular stimuli we evoked calcium transients corresponding to parallel fiber beam activity. This beam activity triggered prolonged calcium transients in interneurons, consistent with in vitro evidence for synaptic activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors via glutamate spillover. We also observed spontaneous calcium transients in Purkinje cell dendrites that were identified as climbing-fiber-evoked calcium spikes by their size, time course, and sensitivity to AMPA receptor antagonist. Two-photon calcium imaging of bulk-loaded cerebellar cortex is thus well suited to optically monitor synaptic processing in the intact cerebellum.},

	abstract = {Experimentally mapping synaptic connections, in terms of the numbers and locations of their synapses and estimating connection probabilities, is still not a tractable task, even for small volumes of tissue. In fact, the six layers of the neocortex contain thousands of unique types of synaptic connections between the many different types of neurons, of which only a handful have been characterized experimentally. Here we present a theoretical framework and a data-driven algorithmic strategy to digitally reconstruct the complete synaptic connectivity between the different types of neurons in a small well-defined volume of tissue—the micro-scale connectome of a neural microcircuit. By enforcing a set of established principles of synaptic connectivity, and leveraging interdependencies between fundamental properties of neural microcircuits to constrain the reconstructed connectivity, the algorithm yields three parameters per connection type that predict the anatomy of all types of biologically viable synaptic connections. The predictions reproduce a spectrum of experimental data on synaptic connectivity not used by the algorithm. We conclude that an algorithmic approach to the connectome can serve as a tool to accelerate experimental mapping, indicating the minimal dataset required to make useful predictions, identifying the datasets required to improve their accuracy, testing the feasibility of experimental measurements, and making it possible to test hypotheses of synaptic connectivity.},

Recent advances in fluorescence imaging permit studies of Ca2+ dynamics in large numbers of cells, in anesthetized and awake behaving animals. However, unlike for electrophysiological signals, standardized algorithms for assigning optically recorded signals to individual cells have not yet emerged. Here, we describe an automated sorting procedure that combines independent component analysis and image segmentation for extracting cells' locations and their dynamics with minimal human supervision. In validation studies using simulated data, automated sorting significantly improved estimation of cellular signals compared to conventional analysis based on image regions of interest. We used automated procedures to analyze data recorded by two-photon Ca2+ imaging in the cerebellar vermis of awake behaving mice. Our analysis yielded simultaneous Ca2+ activity traces for up to \&gt;100 Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia from single recordings. Using this approach, we found microzones of Purkinje cells that were stable across behavioral states and in which synchronous Ca2+ spiking rose significantly during locomotion.},

	abstract = {Successful integration of advanced semiconductor devices with biological systems will accelerate basic scientific discoveries and their translation into clinical technologies. In neuroscience generally, and in optogenetics in particular, the ability to insert light sources, detectors, sensors, and other components into precise locations of the deep brain yields versatile and important capabilities. Here, we introduce an injectable class of cellular-scale optoelectronics that offers such features, with examples of unmatched operational modes in optogenetics, including completely wireless and programmed complex behavioral control over freely moving animals. The ability of these ultrathin, mechanically compliant, biocompatible devices to afford minimally invasive operation in the soft tissues of the mammalian brain foreshadow applications in other organ systems, with potential for broad utility in biomedical science and engineering.
The Smaller, the Better
New semiconductor device technology enables injection of light-emitting diodes, silicon devices, actuators, and sensors at precisely controlled locations within biological tissues, such as the brain. Kim et al. (p. 211) show how wireless control of animal models using these technologies and the techniques of optogenetics provide new insights into basic behavioral neuroscience.},

	abstract = {The analysis of neuroimaging databases typically involves a large number of inter-connected steps called a pipeline. The pipeline system for Octave and Matlab (PSOM) is a flexible framework for the implementation of pipelines in the form of Octave or Matlab scripts. PSOM does not introduce new language constructs to specify the steps and structure of the workflow. All steps of analysis are instead described by a regular Matlab data structure, documenting their associated command and options, as well as their input, output and cleaned-up files. The PSOM execution engine provides a number of automated services: (1) it executes jobs in parallel on a local computing facility as long as the dependencies between jobs allow for it and sufficient resources are available; (2) it generates a comprehensive record of the pipeline stages and the history of execution, which is detailed enough to fully reproduce the analysis; (3) if an analysis is started multiple times, it executes only the parts of the pipeline that need to be reprocessed. PSOM is distributed under an opensource MIT license and can be used without restriction for academic or commercial projects. The package has no external dependencies besides Matlab or Octave, is straightforward to install and supports of variety of operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac). We ran several benchmark experiments on a public database including 200 subjects, using a pipeline for the preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance images. The benchmark results showed that PSOM is a powerful solution for the analysis of large databases using local or distributed computing resources.},

	abstract = {Drug addiction is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by loss of control over motivated behavior. The need for effective treatments mandates a greater understanding of the causes and identification of new therapeutic targets for drug development. Drugs of abuse subjugate normal reward-related behavior to uncontrollable drug-seeking and -taking. Contributions of brain reward circuitry are being mapped with increasing precision. The role of synaptic plasticity in addiction and underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation of the addicted state are being delineated. Thus we may now consider the role of striatal signal transduction in addiction from a more integrative neurobiological perspective. Drugs of abuse alter dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in medium spiny neurons of the striatum. Dopamine receptors important for reward serve as principle targets of drugs abuse, which interact with glutamate receptor signaling critical for reward learning. Complex networks of intracellular signal transduction mechanisms underlying these receptors are strongly stimulated by addictive drugs. Through these mechanisms, repeated drug exposure alters functional and structural neuroplasticity, resulting in transition to the addicted biological state and behavioral outcomes that typify addiction. Ca2+ and cAMP represent key second messengers that initiate signaling cascades, which regulate synaptic strength and neuronal excitability. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are fundamental mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity that are dysregulated by drugs of abuse. Increased understanding of the regulatory mechanisms by which protein kinases and phosphatases exert their effects during normal reward learning and the addiction process may lead to novel targets and pharmacotherapeutics with increased efficacy in promoting abstinence and decreased side effects, such as interference with natural reward, for drug addiction.},

Experimental results have suggested that multiple bursting mechanisms based on a calcium-activated nonspecific cationic (CAN) current, a persistent sodium (NaP) current, and calcium dynamics may be incorporated within the pre-BötC. Previous modeling works have incorporated representations of some or all of these mechanisms. In this study, we consider a single-compartment model of a pre-BötC inspiratory neuron that encompasses particular aspects of all of these features. We present a novel mathematical analysis of the interaction of the corresponding rhythmic mechanisms arising in the model, including square-wave bursting and autonomous calcium oscillations, which requires treatment of a system of differential equations incorporating three slow variables.},

	abstract = {Neuronal network models often assume a fixed probability of connection between neurons. This assumption leads to random networks with binomial in-degree and out-degree distributions which are relatively narrow. Here I study the effect of broad degree distributions on network dynamics by interpolating between a binomial and a truncated power-law distribution for the in-degree and out-degree independently. This is done both for an inhibitory network (I network) as well as for the recurrent excitatory connections in a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons (EI network). In both cases increasing the width of the in-degree distribution affects the global state of the network by driving transitions between asynchronous behavior and oscillations. This effect is reproduced in a simplified rate model which includes the heterogeneity in neuronal input due to the in-degree of cells. On the other hand, broadening the out-degree distribution is shown to increase the fraction of common inputs to pairs of neurons. This leads to increases in the amplitude of the cross-correlation (CC) of synaptic currents. In the case of the I network, despite strong oscillatory CCs in the currents, CCs of the membrane potential are low due to filtering and reset effects, leading to very weak CCs of the spike-count. In the asynchronous regime of the EI network, broadening the out-degree increases the amplitude of CCs in the recurrent excitatory currents, while CC of the total current is essentially unaffected as are pairwise spiking correlations. This is due to a dynamic balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. In the oscillatory regime, changes in the out-degree can have a large effect on spiking correlations and even on the qualitative dynamical state of the network.},

Modifications have previously been proposed to ensure topology preservation and invertibility within this framework. However, in practice, none of these yield the inverse transformation itself, and one loses the parsimonious B-spline parametrisation. We present a novel log-Euclidean FFD approach in which a spline model of a stationary velocity field is exponentiated to yield a diffeomorphism, using an efficient scaling-and-squaring algorithm. The log-Euclidean framework allows easy computation of a consistent inverse transformation, and offers advantages in group-wise atlas building and statistical analysis. We optimise the Normalised Mutual Information plus a regularisation term based on the Jacobian determinant of the transformation, and we present a novel analytical gradient of the latter. The proposed method has been assessed against a fast FFD implementation (F3D) using simulated T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance brain images. The overlap measures between propagated grey matter tissue probability maps used in the simulations show similar results for both approaches; however, our new method obtains more reasonable Jacobian values, and yields inverse transformations.},

	abstract = {Among the different behavioral criteria used to discriminate substance dependence (or drug addiction) from other non-disordered forms of drug use, drug intake escalation presents a number of unique features that makes it particularly suitable for modeling in nonhuman animals. This criterion has stood the passage of time despite major revisions of diagnostic systems, it is common to all known drugs of abuse and it can be readily and unambiguously operationalized in laboratory animals. Here I exhaustively review evidence showing that escalation to heavy consumption of different drugs (except perhaps nicotine) can be rapidly induced in the majority of individual animals (i.e., rats) by increased drug availability. Such an escalation of drug use is probably paralleled by an authentic escalation to drug addiction, as it is associated with the co-occurrence of other addiction-like changes (i.e., increased motivation for drug use; increased difficulty to abstain from drug use; decreased sensitivity to negative consequences). In addition, during escalation of drug intake, most individual animals become increasingly responsive to drug- and stress-primed, but apparently not cue-primed, reinstatement of drug seeking after extinction. Finally, following increased drug use, most individuals present selective cognitive dysfunctions (e.g., deficits in executive functions) that may contribute to the establishment and/or persistence of addiction. Thus, the study of individuals with escalating patterns of drug use should provide a unique and valid approach to investigate, experimentally, the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the progression to addiction.},

We created a genetically encoded, optically controlled pacemaker by expressing halorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin in zebrafish cardiomyocytes. Using patterned illumination in a selective plane illumination microscope, we located the pacemaker and simulated tachycardia, bradycardia, atrioventricular blocks, and cardiac arrest. The pacemaker converges to the sinoatrial region during development and comprises fewer than a dozen cells by the time the heart loops. Perturbation of the activity of these cells was entirely reversible, demonstrating the resilience of the endogenous pacemaker. Our studies combine optogenetics and light-sheet microscopy to reveal the emergence of organ function during development.},

Investigating how a balance between these opposing features is achieved with a dynamic array of cellular and molecular constituents requires long-term tracking of activity from individual neurons. Here, we review in vivo chronic extracellular recording studies and recent long-term two-photon calcium-imaging investigations that address the question of stability and plasticity of neuronal population activity in the mammalian brain. Overall, spiking activity is heterogeneously distributed among neurons in local populations and largely remains stable for individual cells over time. Tuning properties appear more flexible and may be adaptively stabilized, possibly by neuromodulators, to encode reliably and specifically salient stimuli or behaviors.},

MER is often utilized when targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and other deep brain nuclei in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD), tremor, dystonia and other emerging applications. Microelectrodes are used to detect and measure cellular spiking activity while macroelectrodes are considered more suitable for measuring the collective sum of slow potentials from multiple cells near the electrode, the local field potential (LFP). Precisely how the characteristics of an electrode affect the data recorded is still unclear. Technical idiosyncrasies of some surgical cases allowed serendipitous data collection from a 250 to 6000 Hz bandpassed macroelectrode recording during DBS implantation for PD. Simultaneous recording from both a microelectrode and macroelectrode were compared along the same surgical trajectory. Audio, normalized root mean square of the recorded signal, and power spectrograms were used to analyze the data. The analyses demonstrate similar results in detecting cellular spiking activity when recording with macroelectrodes compared with microelectrodes. This has important implications for the standardization of recording electrophysiological data as well as for the development of next generation closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems.},

This hurdle can be lowered using the same technologies that are currently revolutionizing the way that cultural and social media sites represent and share information with their users. Web application technologies and standards such as RESTful webservices, HTML5 and high-performance in-browser JavaScript engines are being utilized to vastly improve the way that the world accesses and shares information. The neuroscience community can also benefit tremendously from these technologies. We present here a web application that allows users to explore and request the complex datasets that need to be shared among the neuroimaging community. The COINS (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite) Data Exchange uses web application technologies to facilitate data sharing in three phases: Exploration, Request/Communication, and Download. This paper will focus on the first phase, and how intuitive exploration of large and complex datasets is achieved using a framework that centers around asynchronous client-server communication (AJAX) and also exposes a powerful API that can be utilized by other applications to explore available data.

It has been suggested recently that underarm cosmetics might be a cause of breast cancer, because these cosmetics contain a variety of chemicals that are applied frequently to an area directly adjacent to the breast. The strongest supporting evidence comes from unexplained clinical observations showing a disproportionately high incidence of breast cancer in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, just the local area to which these cosmetics are applied. A biological basis for breast carcinogenesis could result from the ability of the various constituent chemicals to bind to DNA and to promote growth of the damaged cells. Multidisciplinary research is now needed to study the effect of long-term use of the constituent chemicals of underarm cosmetics, because if there proves to be any link between these cosmetics and breast cancer then there might be options for the prevention of breast cancer.

By expressing VSFPs in pyramidal cells of mouse somatosensory cortex, we also demonstrate that these probes can report cortical electrical responses to single sensory stimuli in vivo. These protein-based voltage probes will facilitate the analysis of cortical circuits in genetically defined cell populations and are hence a valuable addition to the optogenetic toolbox.},

Here, we demonstrate the potential of optogenetic control in cardiac cells using a hybrid experimental/computational technique. Experimentally, we introduced channelrhodopsin-2 into undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells via a lentiviral vector, and sorted and expanded the genetically engineered cells. Via directed differentiation, we created channelrhodopsin-expressing cardiomyocytes, which we subjected to optical stimulation. To quantify the impact of photostimulation, we assessed electrical, biochemical, and mechanical signals using patch-clamping, multielectrode array recordings, and video microscopy. Computationally, we introduced channelrhodopsin-2 into a classic autorhythmic cardiac cell model via an additional photocurrent governed by a light-sensitive gating variable. Upon optical stimulation, the channel opens and allows sodium ions to enter the cell, inducing a fast upstroke of the transmembrane potential. We calibrated the channelrhodopsin-expressing cell model using single action potential readings for different photostimulation amplitudes, pulse widths, and frequencies. To illustrate the potential of the proposed approach, we virtually injected channelrhodopsin-expressing cells into different locations of a human heart, and explored its activation sequences upon optical stimulation. Our experimentally calibrated computational toolbox allows us to virtually probe landscapes of process parameters, and identify optimal photostimulation sequences toward pacing hearts with light.},

	abstract = {Exposure to psychostimulant drugs leads to sensitized locomotor responding, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA) overflow, and drug self-administration upon reexposure to the drug weeks to months later. Calcium-dependent signaling pathways contribute importantly to both the induction and expression of sensitization by these drugs. In particular, calcium-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a serine/threonine kinase that is highly expressed in forebrain regions such as the NAcc, is known to contribute to the expression of several forms of plasticity including sensitization. Notably, pharmacologically inhibiting CaMKII in the NAcc prevents the expression of sensitized locomotion, NAcc DA overflow, and drug taking. Evidence indicates that CaMKII may act both pre- and postsynaptically in this site to influence the expression of these manifestations of sensitization. Presynaptically in DA neuron terminals, CaMKII regulates sensitized DA overflow. Postsynaptically in medium spiny neurons, it contributes to the upregulation of AMPA receptors, the activation of which is necessary for the expression of sensitization. It is conceivable that interactions between CaMKII-mediated neuroadaptations in both of these sites may underlie the long-lasting maintenance of sensitization by psychostimulant drugs.},

Gene therapy trials for Canavan disease, Batten disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, and Parkinson's disease are discussed to illustrate the current state of clinical gene transfer to the CNS. Preclinical studies are under way for a number of diseases, primarily lysosomal storage disorders, using a newer generation of vectors and delivery strategies. Relevant studies in animal models are highlighted for Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB and Krabbe disease to provide a prelude for what can be expected in the coming years for human gene transfer trials, using recent advancements in gene transfer technology.

	abstract = {Multicellular organisms rely on intercellular communication to regulate important cellular processes critical to life. To further our understanding of those processes there is a need to scrutinize dynamical signaling events and their functions in both cells and organisms. Here, we report a method and provide MATLAB code that analyzes time-lapse microscopy recordings to identify and characterize network structures within large cell populations, such as interconnected neurons. The approach is demonstrated using intracellular calcium (Ca2+) recordings in neural progenitors and cardiac myocytes, but could be applied to a wide variety of biosensors employed in diverse cell types and organisms. In this method, network structures are analyzed by applying cross-correlation signal processing and graph theory to single-cell recordings. The goal of the analysis is to determine if the single cell activity constitutes a network of interconnected cells and to decipher the properties of this network. The method can be applied in many fields of biology in which biosensors are used to monitor signaling events in living cells. Analyzing intercellular communication in cell ensembles can reveal essential network structures that provide important biological insights.},

Here we describe a method to control exocytosis of synaptic vesicles through the use of a light-gated glutamate receptor (LiGluR), which has recently been demonstrated that supports secretion by means of calcium influx in chromaffin cells. Expression of LiGluR in hippocampal neurons enables reversible control of neurotransmission with light, and allows modulating the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron with the wavelength of illumination. This method may be useful for the determination of the complex transfer function of individual synapses.},

This “intermediate” signal is vascular in nature but its biological origin not been elucidated. In the present study, an animal model of the signal has been created and our human studies expanded to directly investigate the contribution of non-artifactual vascular motion induced by muscle contraction to the biological origin of this signal. Under non-invasive conditions during stimulation of the exposed sciatic nerve of the Sprague-Dawley rat, optical responses are robust. These signals can be abolished both pharmacologically and surgically using methods that eliminate muscle motion while leaving the electrophysiological health of the nerve intact. In human studies, signals that are elicited on stimulation of nerves containing motor axons, both within and outside the predicted imaging volume of the spectrometer, have similar temporal characteristics of those previously observed. Moreover, stimulation of sensory nerves alone does not elicit an optical response. These results strongly suggest that the intermediate signals are derived from stimulus-induced muscle contraction (whether via an innervating nerve or by direct stimulation) causing translational vascular motion within the optically interrogated region.},

Mice lacking this glucose reserve in muscle, heart, and several other tissues were generated by disruption of the GYS1 gene, which encodes an isoform of glycogen synthase. Crossing mice heterozygous for the GYS1 disruption resulted in a significant underrepresentation of GYS1-null mice in the offspring. Timed matings established that Mendelian inheritance was followed for up to 18.5 days postcoitum (dpc) and that ∼90\% of GYS1-null animals died soon after birth due to impaired cardiac function. Defects in cardiac development began between 11.5 and 14.5 dpc. At 18.5 dpc, the hearts were significantly smaller, with reduced ventricular chamber size and enlarged atria. Consistent with impaired cardiac function, edema, pooling of blood, and hemorrhagic liver were seen. Glycogen synthase and glycogen were undetectable in cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle from the surviving null mice, and the hearts showed normal morphology and function. Congenital heart disease is one of the most common birth defects in humans, at up to 1 in 50 live births. The results provide the first direct evidence that the ability to synthesize glycogen in cardiac muscle is critical for normal heart development and hence that its impairment could be a significant contributor to congenital heart defects.},

This microscope can produce illumination spots of variable size and number, and in patterns shaped to precisely match user-defined elements in a specimen. Using holographic illumination to photolyze caged glutamate in brain slices, we show that shaped excitation on segments of neuronal dendrites and simultaneous, multispot excitation of different dendrites enables precise spatial and rapid temporal control of glutamate receptor activation. By allowing the excitation volume shape to be tailored precisely, the holographic microscope provides an extremely flexible method for activation of various photosensitive proteins and small molecules.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9172258},
	abstract = {This paper starts with definitions of radiance, fluence (rate) and other quantities that are important with regard to in vivo light dosimetry. The light distribution in mammalian tissues can be estimated from model calculations using measured optical properties or from direct measurements of fluence rate using a suitable detector. A historical introduction is therefore followed by a brief discussion of tissue optical properties and of calculations using diffusion theory, the P3-approximation or Monte Carlo simulations. In particular the form of the scattering function is considered in relation to the fluence rate close to the tissue boundary, where light is incident. Non-invasive measurements of optical properties yield the absorption coefficient mu a and mu s(1 - g), where mu s is the scattering coefficient and g is the mean cosine of the scattering angle. An important question is whether this combination is sufficient, or whether g itself must be known. It appears that for strongly forward scattering, as in mammalian tissues, rather detailed knowledge of the scattering function is needed to reliably calculate the fluence rate close to the surface. Deeper in the tissue mu s (1 - g) is sufficient. The construction, calibration and use of fibre-optic probes for measurements of fluence rate in tissues or optical phantoms is discussed. At present, minimally invasive absolute fluence (rate) measurements seem to be possible with an accuracy of 10-20\%. Examples are given of in vivo measurements in animal experiments and in humans during clinical treatments. Measurements in mammalian tissues, plant leaves and marine sediments are compared and similarities and differences pointed out. Most in vivo light fluence rate measurements have been concerned with photodynamic therapy (PDT): Optical properties of the same normal tissue may differ between patients. Tumours of the same histological type may even show different optical properties in a single patient. Treatment-induced changes of optical properties may also occur. Scattered light appears to contribute substantially to the light dose. All these phenomena emphasize the importance of in situ light measurements. Another important dosimetric parameter in PDT is the concentration and distribution of the photosensitizer. Apart from in vivo fluorescence monitoring, the photosensitizer part of in vivo PDT dosimetry is still in its infancy.},

Here we present evidence that this androgen steroid may modulate women's judgments of men's attractiveness in an ecologically valid context. We tested the effects of androstadienone at a speed-dating event in which men and women interacted in a series of brief dyadic encounters. Men were rated more attractive when assessed by women who had been exposed to androstadienone, an effect that was seen in two out of three studies. The results suggest that androstadienone can influence women's attraction to men, and also that research into the modulatory effects of androstadienone should be made within ecologically valid contexts.},

	abstract = {Learning can be motivated by unanticipated success or unexpected failure. The former encourages us to repeat an action or activity, whereas the latter leads us to find an alternative strategy. Understanding the neural representation of these unexpected events is therefore critical to elucidate learning-related circuits. We examined the activity of neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and caudate nucleus of monkeys as they performed a trial-and-error learning task. Unexpected outcomes were widely represented in both structures, and neurons driven by unexpectedly negative outcomes were as frequent as those activated by unexpectedly positive outcomes. Moreover, both positive and negative reward prediction errors (RPEs) were represented primarily by increases in firing rate, unlike the manner in which dopamine neurons have been observed to reflect these values. Interestingly, positive RPEs tended to appear with shorter latency than negative RPEs, perhaps reflecting the mechanism of their generation. Last, in the PFC but not the caudate, trial-by-trial variations in outcome-related activity were linked to the animals' subsequent behavioral decisions. More broadly, the robustness of RPE signaling by these neurons suggests that actor-critic models of reinforcement learning in which the PFC and particularly the caudate are considered primarily to be “actors” rather than “critics,” should be reconsidered to include a prominent evaluative role for these structures.},

	abstract = {Inductive power transmission is widely used to energize implantable microelectronic devices (IMDs), recharge batteries, and energy harvesters. Power transfer efficiency (PTE) and power delivered to the load (PDL) are two key parameters in wireless links, which affect the energy source specifications, heat dissipation, power transmission range, and interference with other devices. To improve the PTE, a 4-coil inductive link has been recently proposed. Through a comprehensive circuit based analysis that can guide a design and optimization scheme, we have shown that despite achieving high PTE at larger coil separations, the 4-coil inductive links fail to achieve a high PDL. Instead, we have proposed a 3-coil inductive power transfer link with comparable PTE over its 4-coil counterpart at large coupling distances, which can also achieve high PDL. We have also devised an iterative design methodology that provides the optimal coil geometries in a 3-coil inductive power transfer link. Design examples of 2-, 3-, and 4-coil inductive links have been presented, and optimized for 13.56 MHz carrier frequency and 12 cm coupling distance, showing PTEs of 15\%, 37\%, and 35\%, respectively. At this distance, the PDL of the proposed 3-coil inductive link is 1.5 and 59 times higher than its equivalent 2- and 4-coil links, respectively. For short coupling distances, however, 2-coil links remain the optimal choice when a high PDL is required, while 4-coil links are preferred when the driver has large output resistance or small power is needed. These results have been verified through simulations and measurements.},

The chapter first includes a brief discussion of current clinical conceptions of craving. This is followed by an argument for what aspect of human craving animals may experience. This leads to a description of various animal models (primarily using rats) that indirectly measure activity of a basic craving mechanism. A final section is provided with examples of the utility of animal models of craving illustrated with translational evidence. It is argued that basic craving is amenable to study by animal models of craving that measure motivated drug seeking behavior. Furthermore, reflection on a distinction between conscious (subjective) craving and basic craving leads to the following possible conclusions: one could treat the conscious craving and this would provide some benefit to the addict. But what would remain is the basic craving response to drug-paired stimuli, situations, and even drug-focused thought processes. Reducing basic craving using pharmaco- or behavioral therapies based upon animal model findings may ultimately be more effective at reducing relapse behaviors.},

Reducing the size of the monitoring and stimulating electrodes by orders of magnitude (to the size of neural elements) allows remarkable improvements in both monitoring (spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and sensitivity) and stimulation. Carbon nanofiber nanoelectrode technology offers the possibility of trimodal arrays (monitoring electrical activity, monitoring neurotransmitter levels, precise stimulation). DBS can then be guided by changes in brain electrical activity and/or neurotransmitter levels (i.e. closed-loop DBS). Here, we describe the basic manufacture and electrical characteristics of a prototype nanoelectrode array for DBS, as well as preliminary studies with electroconductive polymers necessary to optimize DBS in vivo. An approach such as the nanoelectrode array described here may offer a generic electrical-neural interface for use in various neural prostheses.},

It does not automatically adapt to the instantaneous patient's needs or to the progression of the disease. This paper demonstrates an adaptive closed-loop controlled DBS that, after switching off stimulation, tracks few physiological signals to predict the reappearance of tremor before the patient experiences discomfort, at which point it instructs the DBS controller to switch on stimulation again. The core of the proposed approach is a Neural Network (NN) which effectively extracts tremor predictive information from non-invasively recorded surface-electromyogram(sEMG) and accelerometer signals measured at the symptomatic extremities. A simple feed-forward back-propagation NN architecture is shown to successfully predict tremor in 31 out of 33 trials in two Parkinson's Disease patients with an overall accuracy of 75.8\% and sensitivity of 92.3\%. This work therefore shows that closed-loop DBS control is feasible in the near future and that it can be achieved without modifications of the electrodes implanted in the brain, i.e., is backward compatible with approved DBS systems.},

Deep brain stimulation can provide striking tremor relief, but the introduction of stimulating electrodes deep in the substance of the brain carries significant risks, including those of hemorrhage. Here, we pioneer an alternative approach in which we noninvasively apply transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) over the motor cortex to induce phase cancellation of the rest tremor rhythm. We first identify the timing of cortical oscillations responsible for rest tremor in the periphery by delivering tremor-frequency stimulation over motor cortex but do not couple this stimulation to the on-going tremor-instead, the rhythms simply "drift" in and out of phase alignment with one another. Slow alternating periods of phase cancellation and reinforcement result, informing on the phase alignments that induce the greatest change in tremor amplitude. Next, we deliver stimulation at these specified phase alignments to demonstrate controlled suppression of the on-going tremor. With this technique we can achieve almost 50\% average reduction in resting tremor amplitude and in so doing form the basis of a closed-loop tremor-suppression therapy that could be extended to other oscillopathies.},

	abstract = {We compare relative performances of flat-tipped, beveled (two-fiber and six-around-one), and single-lensed focused fiber-optic Raman probes and, where feasible, evaluate the utility of optical filters for reducing fiber background. The sensitivity profile of each probe is determined by measuring the relative intensity of light backscattered off a flat surface as a function of distance from the probe tip. The experimental results are compared with a simple light-cone-overlap model incorporating fiber numerical aperture, fiber and immersion medium refractive indices, separation between excitation and collection fibers, number of fibers, and fiber bevel angle and/or lens focal length. The model and sensitivity profiles are used to interpret the sampling regions for Raman spectra obtained by using each of the probes with a clear, transparent sample (single-crystal sparry calcite), a white, partially transparent sample (acetaminophen tablet), and a set of organic liquids of varying refractive index. The sensitivity of the tested commercial lensed probe drops off symmetrically about the focal point. For both solid samples, the intensity of fiber background follows a profile determined primarily by laser backscattering off the surface, whereas the sample Raman signal follows a profile dependent upon sampling depth.},

	abstract = {Social interactions are multifaceted, composed of interlinked sensory-motor behaviors. The individual significance of each of these correlated components cannot be established without observing the full behavior. Recently, Wesson [1] concluded that rats display their submissive status by lowering sniff rate following face-to-face encounters with a dominant conspecific. How rats can perceive such changes in sniff rate is unclear. We recorded sniffing and vocal production of rats during social interactions. Face-to-face encounters with a dominant rat immediately elicited 22 kHz alarm calls in the submissive. The large drop in sniff rate observed in submissive rats was caused by the prolonged exhalations needed to produce these calls. We propose that, while submissive rats do lower sniffing rates around face-to-face encounters, dominant rats need not directly perceive this change, but may instead attend to the salient 22 kHz alarm calls.},

One feature common to many abused drugs is the phenomenon of “withdrawal,” which results from abrupt termination of drug administration. The initial phases of drug withdrawal, often referred to as the “crash” phase in humans, are characterized by dramatic psychological changes which may or may not be accompanied by somatic symptoms. The psychological symptoms, including disruptions in affect and cognition, are most commonly observed following psychostimulant withdrawal. This transient state strongly resembles the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) in humans. The majority of rodent paradigms of psychostimulant withdrawal accurately model this human condition, and sophisticated preclinical protocols have been used to quantify psychological changes, such as anhedonia. In the present review, we describe past and current progress in modeling psychostimulant withdrawal in rodents, as well as potential limitations of this model.},

	abstract = {Mutual information is a principled non-linear measure of dependence between stochastic variables, which is widely used to study the selectivity of neural responses to external stimuli. Here we define and develop a set of novel statistical independence tests based on mutual information, which quantify the significance of neural selectivity to either single features or to multiple, potentially correlated stimulus features like those often present in naturalistic stimuli. If the values of different features are correlated during stimulus presentation, it is difficult to establish if one feature is genuinely encoded by the response, or if it instead appears to be encoded only as a side effect of its correlation with another genuinely represented feature. Our tests provide a way to disambiguate between these two possibilities. We use realistic simulations of neural responses tuned to one or more correlated stimulus features to investigate how limited sampling bias correction procedures affect the statistical power of such independence tests, and we characterize the regimes in which the distribution of information values under the null hypothesis can be approximated by simple distributions (Chi-square or Gaussian). Finally, we apply these tests to experimental data to determine the significance of tuning of the band limited power (BLP) of the gamma [30–100 Hz] frequency range of the primary visual cortical local field potential to multiple correlated features during presentation of naturalistic movies. We show that gamma BLP carries significant, genuine information about orientation, space contrast and time contrast, despite the strong correlations between these features.},

Velocity through living human tissues, consisting mostly of muscle, is measured by transmitting the ultrasound through various thicknesses of the arm, leg, and thigh. Specific gravities of the tissues are measured. The characteristic acoustic impedances (ρc values), calculated from the density and velocity data, vary between 1.5×105 and 1.7×105 g/cm2/sec.

	abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that monkeys and humans can use signals from the brain to guide computer cursors. Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) may one day assist patients suffering from neurological injury or disease, but relatively low system performance remains a major obstacle. In fact, the speed and accuracy with which keys can be selected using BCIs is still far lower than for systems relying on eye movements. This is true whether BCIs use recordings from populations of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques or electroencephalogram recordings using less- or non-invasive techniques. Here we present the design and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor cortex, of a manyfold higher performance BCI than previously reported. These results indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or {\textasciitilde}15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system design should substantially increase the clinical viability of BCIs in humans.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in fluorescent confocal microscopy and voltage-sensitive and Ca2+ dyes have vastly improved our ability to image neuronal circuits. However, existing confocal systems are not fast enough or too noisy for many live-cell functional imaging studies. Here, we describe and demonstrate the function of a novel, nonscanning confocal microscopy module. The optics, which are designed to fit the standard camera port of the Olympus BX51WI epifluorescent microscope, achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high temporal resolution, making this configuration ideal for functional imaging of neuronal activities such as the voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging. The optics employ fixed 100- × 100-pinhole arrays at the back focal plane (optical conjugation plane), above the tube lens of a usual upright microscope. The excitation light travels through these pinholes, and the fluorescence signal, emitted from subject, passes through corresponding pinholes before exciting the photodiodes of the imager: a 100- × 100-pixel metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS)-type pixel imager with each pixel corresponding to a single 100- × 100-μm photodiode. This design eliminated the need for a scanning device; therefore, acquisition rate of the imager (maximum rate of 10 kHz) is the only factor limiting acquisition speed. We tested the application of the system for VSD and Ca2+ imaging of evoked neuronal responses on electrical stimuli in rat hippocampal slices. The results indicate that, at least for these applications, the new microscope maintains a high SNR at image acquisition rates of ≤0.3 ms per frame.},

A PubMed literature search was conducted to identify all studies that have investigated the use of DBS for treatment of dementia. 
Results 
Three studies examined the use of DBS for dementia. One study involved fornix DBS for Alzheimer disease (AD), and two studies involved DBS of the nucleus basalis of Meynert, one to treat AD and one to treat Parkinson disease dementia. 
Conclusuions 
Evidence for the use of DBS to treat dementia is preliminary and limited. Fornix and nucleus basalis of Meynert DBS can influence activity in the pathologic neural circuits that underlie AD and Parkinson disease dementia. Further investigation into the potential clinical effects of DBS for dementia is warranted.},

Our system uses LED ring lights that can be mounted on standard microscope objectives or video lenses to provide a homogeneous and stable light source, with less than 0.003\% fluctuation across images averaged from 40 trials. We describe the equipment and surgical techniques necessary for both acute and chronic mouse preparations, and provide software that can create maps of sensory representations from images captured by inexpensive 8-bit cameras or by 12-bit cameras. The IOS imaging system can be adapted to commercial upright microscopes or custom macroscopes, eliminating the need for dedicated equipment or complex optical paths. This method can be combined with parallel high resolution imaging techniques such as two-photon microscopy.},

Previous research has primarily centered on accurately decoding movement intention from either plan or perimovement activity, but has assumed that temporal boundaries between these epochs are known to the decoding system. In this work, we develop a technique to automatically differentiate between baseline, plan, and perimovement epochs of neural activity. Specifically, we use a generative model of neural activity to capture how neural activity varies between these three epochs. Our approach is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM), in which the latent variable (state) corresponds to the epoch of neural activity, coupled with a state-dependent Poisson firing model. Using an HMM, we demonstrate that the time of transition from baseline to plan epochs, a transition in neural activity that is not accompanied by any external behavior changes, can be detected using a threshold on the a posteriori HMM state probabilities. Following detection of the plan epoch, we show that the intended target of a center-out movement can be detected about as accurately as that by a maximum-likelihood estimator using a window of known plan activity. In addition, we demonstrate that our HMM can detect transitions in neural activity corresponding to targets not found in training data. Thus the HMM technique for automatically detecting transitions between epochs of neural activity enables prosthetic interfaces that can operate autonomously.},

	abstract = {We derive a new self-organizing learning algorithm that maximizes the information transferred in a network of nonlinear units. The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing.},

This imaging head consists of two conical mirrors, which considerably reduce multiple back reflections between the animal and mirror surfaces. These back reflections are common in existing mirror-based imaging heads and tend to degrade the quality of raw measurement data. In addition, the introduction of a novel ray-transfer operator allows for the inclusion of the angular dependent data in the image reconstruction process, which results in higher image resolution. We describe in detail the system design and implementation of the hardware components as well as the transport-theory-based image reconstruction algorithm.

	abstract = {This chapter provides an exhaustive overview of the current repertoire of animal models for alcoholism research. The chapter covers behavioral procedures modeling different stages of the alcohol addiction cycle, including strategies for investigating ethanol reinforcement, ethanol dependence, binge drinking, ethanol craving, and susceptibility to relapse. Moreover, the description and evaluation of the utility of these models is presented within a historical context, as well as an assessment of specific needs for future model development. The chapter emphasizes that the primary objective of contemporary research on alcohol abuse and addiction is to explain the processes that compel some but not other individuals to drink excessively, the identification of brain mechanisms that support the acute reinforcing actions of alcohol in nondependent subjects, and abnormalities in these mechanisms that are responsible for the development of dependence and the compulsive character of ethanol seeking and use in alcohol-addicted individuals. With respect to the development and successful implementation of valid animal models of self-administration and addiction, a number of issues must be considered in the case of alcohol due to the fact that (a) voluntary alcohol consumption in animals is generally low, except in animals that have been genetically selected for high spontaneous ethanol preference, and (b) that the conditions that make excessive alcohol consumption a reinforcing event in some subjects and not others are complex because they involve interactions among genetic, psychosocial-environmental, and neurobiological factors. Despite these challenges, a wide array of animal models is available that permits investigation of behaviors directed at obtaining access to and consuming alcohol as well as the identification of neurobiological, genetic, environmental, and motivational factors regulating these behaviors in both the nondependent and dependent states. These models also are instrumental for identifying pharmacological treatment targets for intervention at different stages of the addiction cycle and as preclinical tools for evaluating the efficacy of potential medications for the treatment of excessive alcohol use and the prevention of alcohol craving and relapse.},

	abstract = {While modulating neural activity through stimulation is an effective treatment for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, an opportunity for improving neuromodulation therapy remains in automatically adjusting therapy to continuously optimize patient outcomes. Practical issues associated with achieving this include the paucity of human data related to disease states, poorly validated estimators of patient state, and unknown dynamic mappings of optimal stimulation parameters based on estimated states. To overcome these challenges, we present an investigational platform including: an implanted sensing and stimulation device to collect data and run automated closed-loop algorithms; an external tool to prototype classifier and control-policy algorithms; and real-time telemetry to update the implanted device firmware and monitor its state. The prototyping system was demonstrated in a chronic large animal model studying hippocampal dynamics. We used the platform to find biomarkers of the observed states and transfer functions of different stimulation amplitudes. Data showed that moderate levels of stimulation suppress hippocampal beta activity, while high levels of stimulation produce seizure-like after-discharge activity. The biomarker and transfer function observations were mapped into classifier and control-policy algorithms, which were downloaded to the implanted device to continuously titrate stimulation amplitude for the desired network effect. The platform is designed to be a flexible prototyping tool and could be used to develop improved mechanistic models and automated closed-loop systems for a variety of neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {Neuroscientists use many different software tools to acquire, analyze and visualize electrophysiological signals. However, incompatible data models and file formats make it difficult to exchange data between these tools. This reduces scientific productivity, renders potentially useful analysis methods inaccessible and impedes collaboration between labs. A common representation of the core data would improve interoperability and facilitate data-sharing. To that end, we propose here a language-independent object model, named “Neo,” suitable for representing data acquired from electroencephalographic, intracellular, or extracellular recordings, or generated from simulations. As a concrete instantiation of this object model we have developed an open source implementation in the Python programming language. In addition to representing electrophysiology data in memory for the purposes of analysis and visualization, the Python implementation provides a set of input/output (IO) modules for reading/writing the data from/to a variety of commonly used file formats. Support is included for formats produced by most of the major manufacturers of electrophysiology recording equipment and also for more generic formats such as MATLAB. Data representation and data analysis are conceptually separate: it is easier to write robust analysis code if it is focused on analysis and relies on an underlying package to handle data representation. For that reason, and also to be as lightweight as possible, the Neo object model and the associated Python package are deliberately limited to representation of data, with no functions for data analysis or visualization. Software for neurophysiology data analysis and visualization built on top of Neo automatically gains the benefits of interoperability, easier data sharing and automatic format conversion; there is already a burgeoning ecosystem of such tools. We intend that Neo should become the standard basis for Python tools in neurophysiology.},

These INs undergo continuous turnover in the adult OB in a process known as “adult neurogenesis.” Although the overall magnitude of adult neurogenesis has been estimated, the detailed dynamics of the different subpopulations remains largely unknown. Here we present a novel preparation that enables long-term in vivo time-lapse imaging in the mouse OB through a chronic cranial window in a virtually unlimited number of sessions. Using this preparation, we followed the turnover of a specific neuronal population in the OB, the dopaminergic (DA) neurons, for as long as 9 months. By following the same population over long periods of time, we found clear addition and loss of DA neurons in the glomerular layer. Both cell addition and loss increased over time. The numbers of new DA cells were consistently and significantly higher than lost DA cells, suggesting a net increase in the size of this particular population with age. Over a 9 month period of adult life, the net addition of DA neurons reached ∼13\%. Our data argue that the fine composition of the bulbar IN network changes throughout adulthood rather than simply being replenished.},

To date, no studies have explored the neural correlates associated with increases in cognitive load whilst performing a motor task in patients with freezing. In this experiment, 14 PD patients with and 15 PD patients without freezing of gait underwent 3T fMRI while performing a virtual reality gait task. Directions to walk and stop were presented on the viewing screen as either direct cues or as more cognitively indirect pre-learned cues. Both groups showed a consistent pattern of BOLD response within the Cognitive Control Network during performance of the paradigm. However, a between group comparison revealed that those PD patients with freezing of gait were less able to recruit the bilateral anterior insula, ventral striatum and the pre-supplementary motor area, as well as the left subthalamic nucleus when responding to indirect cognitive cues whilst maintaining a motor output. These results suggest that PD patients with freezing of gait are unable to properly recruit specific cortical and subcortical regions within the Cognitive Control Network during the performance of simultaneous motor and cognitive functions.},

Specifically, the PAM system was redesigned to efficiently collect photoacoustic waves originating from cortical vessels, providing high (70 μm lateral and 54 μm axial) resolution images of the mouse brain vasculature with a contrast-to-noise ratio of 25 dB. These findings confirm the efficacy of PAM to noninvasively image vascular structures in the mouse brain and the potential to image mouse brain function by tracking the hemodynamic response.},

Results show that our method is well suited to aggregate many surgical constraints and allows the analysis of thousands of trajectories in less than 1/10th of the time for manual planning. Finally, a qualitative evaluation of computed trajectories resulted in the identification of potential new constraints, which are not addressed in the current literature, to better mimic the decision-making of the neurosurgeon during DBS planning.},

Our results reveal that the same neural mass network may process different combinations of dynamical inputs as different logical operations or combinations of them. This dynamical feature of the network allows it to process complex inputs in a very sophisticated manner. The results are reproduced experimentally with electronic circuits of coupled Chua oscillators, showing the robustness of this kind of computation to the intrinsic noise and parameter mismatch of the coupled oscillators. We also show that the information-processing capabilities of coupled oscillations go beyond the simple juxtaposition of logic gates.},

Though considerable advances have been made, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS remain unclear despite its clinical efficacy. It is now widely held that both excitation and inhibition can occur secondary to stimulation, and it is suspected that abnormal synchronized oscillations may also be important in the mechanism of DBS. Other potentially important processes, including blood flow changes, local and upstream neurogenesis, and the modulation of neurotransmitters through stimulation of bordering astrocytes are also being investigated. Recent research has suggested that the temporal pattern of DBS stimulation is also an important variable in DBS neuromodulation, yet the extent of its influence on DBS efficacy has yet to be determined. As high stimulation frequency alone does not appear to be sufficient for optimal symptom suppression, attention to stimulation pattern might lead to more effective symptom control and reduced side effects, possibly at a lower frequency. Stimulation pattern may be potentially amenable to therapeutic modulation and its role in the clinical efficacy of DBS should be addressed through further focus and research.},

We expressed a common construct, CAG::ChR2 (H134R)-EYFP-WPRE, in L2/3 pyramidal cells in rat somatosensory cortex via in utero DNA electroporation (IUE). L2/3 pyramidal cells expressed ChR2-EYFP, but histology revealed abnormal morphology and targeting of ChR2-EYFP expressing axons, beginning at postnatal day (P) 33 and increasing with age. Axonal abnormalities included cylinders that enveloped pyramidal cell proximal apical dendrites, and spherical, calyx-like structures that surrounded neuronal cell bodies, including in L4. These are abnormal subcellular and laminar targets for L2/3 pyramidal cell synapses. Abnormalities did not occur in cells expressing GFP instead of ChR2, or in intermixed ChR2-negative axons. Long-term viral-mediated expression (80 d) did not cause axonal abnormalities when the CAG promoter was used, but produced some abnormalities with the stronger αCaMKII promoter (albeit much less than with in utero electroporation). Thus, under some circumstances high-level, long-term expression of ChR2-EYFP can perturb the structural organization of cortical circuits.},

	abstract = {The application of fluorescence microscopy in cell biology often generates a huge amount of imaging data. Automated whole cell segmentation of such data enables the detection and analysis of individual cells, where a manual delineation is often time consuming, or practically not feasible. Furthermore, compared to manual analysis, automation normally has a higher degree of reproducibility. CellSegm, the software presented in this work, is a Matlab based command line software toolbox providing an automated whole cell segmentation of images showing surface stained cells, acquired by fluorescence microscopy. It has options for both fully automated and semi-automated cell segmentation. Major algorithmic steps are: (i) smoothing, (ii) Hessian-based ridge enhancement, (iii) marker-controlled watershed segmentation, and (iv) feature-based classfication of cell candidates. Using a wide selection of image recordings and code snippets, we demonstrate that CellSegm has the ability to detect various types of surface stained cells in 3D. After detection and outlining of individual cells, the cell candidates can be subject to software based analysis, specified and programmed by the end-user, or they can be analyzed by other software tools. A segmentation of tissue samples with appropriate characteristics is also shown to be resolvable in CellSegm. The command-line interface of CellSegm facilitates scripting of the separate tools, all implemented in Matlab, offering a high degree of flexibility and tailored workflows for the end-user. The modularity and scripting capabilities of CellSegm enable automated workflows and quantitative analysis of microscopic data, suited for high-throughput image based screening.},

The system is based on a simple design, consisting of a microdrive, control electronics, software, and a unique type of recording chamber. The microdrive consists of an aluminum frame, a set of eight linear actuators driven by computer-controlled miniature stepping motors, and two printed circuit boards (PCBs) that provide connectivity to the electrodes and the control electronics. The control circuitry is structured around an Atmel RISC-based microcontroller, which sends commands to as many as eight motor control cards, each capable of controlling eight motors. The microcontroller is programmed in C and uses serial communication to interface with a host computer. The graphical user interface for sending commands is written in C and runs on a conventional personal computer. The recording chamber is low in profile, mounts within a circular craniotomy, and incorporates a removable internal sleeve. A replaceable Sylastic membrane can be stretched across the bottom opening of the sleeve to provide a watertight seal between the cranial cavity and the external environment. This greatly reduces the susceptibility to infection, nearly eliminates the need for routine cleaning, and permits repeated introduction of electrodes into the brain at the same sites while maintaining the watertight seal. The system is reliable, easy to use, and has several advantages over other commercially available systems with similar capabilities.},

	abstract = {Much progress has been made in uncovering the computational capabilities of spiking neural networks. However, spiking neurons will always be more expensive to simulate compared to rate neurons because of the inherent disparity in time scales - the spike duration time is much shorter than the inter-spike time, which is much shorter than any learning time scale. In numerical analysis, this is a classic stiff problem. Spiking neurons are also much more difficult to study analytically. One possible approach to making spiking networks more tractable is to augment mean field activity models with some information about spiking correlations. For example, such a generalized activity model could carry information about spiking rates and correlations between spikes self-consistently. Here, we will show how this can be accomplished by constructing a complete formal probabilistic description of the network and then expanding around a small parameter such as the inverse of the number of neurons in the network. The mean field theory of the system gives a rate-like description. The first order terms in the perturbation expansion keep track of covariances.},

	abstract = {Many experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that the reliable propagation of synchronous neural activity is crucial for neural information processing. The propagation of synchronous firing activity in so-called synfire chains has been studied extensively in feed-forward networks of spiking neurons. However, it remains unclear how such neural activity could emerge in recurrent neuronal networks through synaptic plasticity. In this study, we investigate whether local excitation, i.e., neurons that fire at a higher frequency than the other, spontaneously active neurons in the network, can shape a network to allow for synchronous activity propagation. We use two-dimensional, locally connected and heterogeneous neuronal networks with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We find that, in our model, local excitation drives profound network changes within seconds. In the emergent network, neural activity propagates synchronously through the network. This activity originates from the site of the local excitation and propagates through the network. The synchronous activity propagation persists, even when the local excitation is removed, since it derives from the synaptic weight matrix. Importantly, once this connectivity is established it remains stable even in the presence of spontaneous activity. Our results suggest that synfire-chain-like activity can emerge in a relatively simple way in realistic neural networks by locally exciting the desired origin of the neuronal sequence.},

With increasing research on system integration for image-guided therapy (IGT), there has been a strong demand for standardized communication among devices and software to share data such as target positions, images and device status.

Method
We propose a new, open, simple and extensible network communication protocol for IGT, named OpenIGTLink, to transfer transform, image and status messages. We conducted performance tests and use-case evaluations in five clinical and engineering scenarios.

Results
The protocol was able to transfer position data with submillisecond latency up to 1024 fps and images with latency of {\textless}10 ms at 32 fps. The use-case tests demonstrated that the protocol is feasible for integrating devices and software.

Conclusion
The protocol proved capable of handling data required in the IGT setting with sufficient time resolution and latency. The protocol not only improves the interoperability of devices and software but also promotes transitions of research prototypes to clinical applications..},

We make use of this principle to introduce a scanning version of oblique back-illumination microscopy, or sOBM. This technique provides sub-surface phase-gradient and amplitude images from unlabeled tissue, in an epi-detection geometry. That is, it may be applied to arbitrarily thick tissue. sOBM may be implemented as a simple, cost-effective add-on with any scanning microscope, requiring only the availability of an extra input channel in the microscope electronics. We demonstrate here its implementation in combination with two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy and with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, applied to brain or spinal cord tissue imaging. In both cases, sOBM provides information on tissue morphology complementary to TPEF or CARS contrast. This information is obtained simultaneously and is automatically co-registered. Finally, we show that sOBM can be operated at video rate.},

Studies reveal a variety of apparently discrepant results. At the least, it is unclear which DBS effects are therapeutically effective. This systematic review attempts to organize current DBS research into a series of unifying themes or issues such as whether the therapeutic effects are local or systems-wide or whether the effects are related to inhibition or excitation. A number of alternative hypotheses are offered for consideration including suppression of abnormal activity, striping basal ganglia output of misinformation, reduction of abnormal stochastic resonance effects due to increased noise in the disease state, and reinforcement of dynamic modulation of neuronal activity by resonance effects.},

We also address effects caused by void-like heterogeneities in which absorption and scattering are very small compared with the surrounding medium. Based on results for simple homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, we analyse diffusion and transport calculation of light propagation in the human brain. For these simulations we convert density maps obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to optical-parameter maps ( and ) of the brain.

The target for DBS and the stimulation parameters to be used are unknown. Here, we implanted bilateral electrodes in the vicinity of the fornix, a key element of the memory circuitry, and applied DBS with different stimulation frequencies and amplitudes in an experimental model of dementia. Rats received scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, to mimic memory impairment. Rats were then tested in the object location task with the following conditions: (i) with attachment of stimulation cable (off stimulation), and (ii) with DBS at various amplitudes (50 μA, 100 μA and 200 μA), 100 μs pulse width and 100 Hz or 10 Hz stimulation frequency. DBS reversed the memory impairing effects of scopolamine when compared to sham rats. We found that the fornix is not sensitive to the frequency of stimulation, but rather to current levels. With the most optimal stimulation parameter, we found no side-effects on anxiety levels and general motor activity. These findings identify the fornix as a key region in controlling spatial memory functions. DBS of this region, using tailored stimulation parameters, has the potential to improve memory functions in conditions characterised by memory impairment.},

The Fourier ptychography technique in reflection mode has great potential applications in tissue imaging and optical inspection, but the current configuration either has a limitation on cut-off frequency or is not practical. By placing the imaging aperture stop outside the illumination path, the illumination numerical aperture (NA) can be greater than the imaging NA of the objective lens. Thus, the cut-off frequency achieved in the proposed optical system is greater than twice the objective’s NA divided by the wavelength (2NAobj/λ), which is the diffraction limit for the cut-off frequency in an incoherent epi-illumination configuration. We experimentally demonstrated that the synthesized NA is increased by a factor of 4.5 using the proposed optical concept. The key advantage of the proposed system is that it can achieve high-resolution imaging over a large field of view with a simple objective. It will have a great potential for applications in endoscopy, biomedical imaging, surface metrology, and industrial inspection.},

In this study, a new model of the closed loop network is used to explore the generation and interaction of network oscillations and their suppression through deep brain stimulation (DBS). Under simulated dopamine depletion conditions, increased gain through the hyperdirect pathway resulted in the interaction of neural oscillations at different frequencies in the cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN), leading to the emergence of synchronized oscillations at a new intermediate frequency. Further increases in synaptic gain resulted in the cortex driving synchronous oscillatory activity throughout the network. When DBS was added to the model a progressive reduction in STN power at the tremor and beta frequencies was observed as the frequency of stimulation was increased, with resonance effects occurring for low frequency DBS (\${\textless}\$40 Hz) in agreement with experimental observations. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which synchronous oscillations can arise within the network and how DBS may suppress unwanted oscillatory activity.},

To be able to infer meaningful conclusions quickly and accurately from large datasets, automated and sophisticated signal processing and analysis tools are required. This paper presents a Matlab-based novel tool, “SigMate”, incorporating standard methods to analyze spikes and EEG signals, and in-house solutions for local field potentials (LFPs) analysis. Available modules at present are – 1. In-house developed algorithms for: data display (2D and 3D), file operations (file splitting, file concatenation, and file column rearranging), baseline correction, slow stimulus artifact removal, noise characterization and signal quality assessment, current source density (CSD) analysis, latency estimation from LFPs and CSDs, determination of cortical layer activation order using LFPs and CSDs, and single LFP clustering; 2. Existing modules: spike detection, sorting and spike train analysis, and EEG signal analysis. SigMate has the flexibility of analyzing multichannel signals as well as signals from multiple recording sources. The in-house developed tools for LFP analysis have been extensively tested with signals recorded using standard extracellular recording electrode, and planar and implantable multi transistor array (MTA) based neural probes. SigMate will be disseminated shortly to the neuroscience community under the open-source GNU-General Public License.},

	abstract = {Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) is an operant behavioral paradigm in which experimental animals learn to deliver brief electrical pulses into specific regions of their own brains that are considered to be part of the brain’s reward pathways mediating both natural and ICSS reward. Several brain sites support ICSS, with the lateral hypothalamus, medial forebrain (MFB) bundle, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) among the sites that produce the most vigorous ICSS responding. Various ICSS procedures have been designed and used during the last decades since the discovery of ICSS. Two of the most commonly used ICSS procedures, which have been experimentally validated and have shown to be reward-selective, are the rate-frequency curve-shift procedure and the discrete-trial current-intensity threshold procedure. In all ICSS procedures, lowering of ICSS thresholds indicates a facilitation of brain stimulation reward, whereas elevations in ICSS thresholds reflect the diminished reward value of the stimulation and thus an anhedonic state. Acute administration of most drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, morphine, and heroin, lower ICSS thresholds in experimental animals. By contrast, withdrawal from chronic administration of these compounds induces elevations in ICSS thresholds, indicating an anhedonic state that resembles the negative affective state of the drug withdrawal syndrome experienced by humans. However, certain drugs of abuse, such as ethanol and cannabinoids, have shown inconsistent effects in ICSS procedures, primarily because of the minimal effects induced by these drugs in the ICSS procedure. In summary, the ICSS procedure provides unique ways to investigate the anatomical basis of reward and motivation and is an important tool for the assessment of the reward-facilitating and anhe­donic effects of various drugs of abuse with addictive properties.},

The macroscope incorporates epi-illumination, a 0.4 numerical aperture, and a 40 mm working distance for imaging wide fields in the range of 1.5-20 mm in diameter. At magnifications of 1X to 2.5X, fluorescence images acquired with the macroscope were 100-700 times brighter than those obtained with commercial microscope objectives at similar magnifications. In several biological applications, the improved light collection efficiency (20-fold, typical) not only minimized bleaching effects, but, in concert with improved illumination throughput (15-fold, typical), significantly enhanced object visibility as well. Reduced phototoxicity and increased signal-to-noise ratios were observed in the in vivo real-time optical imaging of cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes. Furthermore, the macroscope has a depth of field which is 5-10 times thinner than that of a conventional low-power microscope. This shallow depth of field has facilitated the imaging of cortical architecture based on activity-dependent intrinsic cortical signals in the living primate brain. In these reflection measurements large artifacts from the surface blood vessels, which were observed with conventional lenses, were eliminated with the macroscope.},

Recent evidence has demonstrated reduction of beta oscillations concurrent with alleviation of PD motor symptoms, raising the possibility that suppression of aberrant activity may mediate the effects of DBS. Here we review the evidence supporting suppression of pathological oscillations during stimulation and discuss how this might underlie the efficacy of DBS.

The rats were subsequently trained over a period of weeks to modulate their motor cortex ensemble unit activity upon delivery of intra-cortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the visual cortex in order to receive a food reward. Rats were given continuous feedback via visual cortex ICMS during the response periods that was representative of the motor cortex ensemble dynamics. Analysis revealed that the feedback provided the animals with indicators of the behavioral trials.

	abstract = {Brain regions of human subjects exhibit certain levels of associated activation upon specific environmental stimuli. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) detects regional signals, based on which we could infer the direct or indirect neuronal connectivity between the regions. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is an appropriate mathematical approach for analyzing the effective connectivity using fMRI data. A maximum likelihood (ML) discrepancy function is minimized against some constrained coefficients of a path model. The minimization is an iterative process. The computing time is very long as the number of iterations increases geometrically with the number of path coefficients. Using regular Quad-Core Central Processing Unit (CPU) platform, duration up to 3 months is required for the iterations from 0 to 30 path coefficients. This study demonstrates the application of Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) with the parallel Genetic Algorithm (GA) that replaces the Powell minimization in the standard program code of the analysis software package. It was found in the same example that GA under GPU reduced the duration to 20 h and provided more accurate solution when compared with standard program code under CPU.},

Studies employing these advanced techniques revealed that synchronization of oscillatory responses in the β- and γ-band is involved in a variety of cognitive functions, such as perceptual grouping, attention-dependent stimulus selection, routing of signals across distributed cortical networks, sensory-motor integration, working memory, and perceptual awareness. Here, we review evidence that certain brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's are associated with abnormal neural synchronization. The data suggest close correlations between abnormalities in neuronal synchronization and cognitive dysfunctions, emphasizing the importance of temporal coordination. Thus, focused search for abnormalities in temporal patterning may be of considerable clinical relevance.},

	abstract = {Experiments to monitor human brain activity during active behavior record a variety of modalities (e.g., EEG, eye tracking, motion capture, respiration monitoring) and capture a complex environmental context leading to large, event-rich time series datasets. The considerable variability of responses within and among subjects in more realistic behavioral scenarios requires experiments to assess many more subjects over longer periods of time. This explosion of data requires better computational infrastructure to more systematically explore and process these collections. MOBBED is a lightweight, easy-to-use, extensible toolkit that allows users to incorporate a computational database into their normal MATLAB workflow. Although capable of storing quite general types of annotated data, MOBBED is particularly oriented to multichannel time series such as EEG that have event streams overlaid with sensor data. MOBBED directly supports access to individual events, data frames and time-stamped feature vectors, allowing users to ask questions such as what types of events or features co-occur under various experimental conditions. A database provides several advantages not available to users who process one dataset at a time from the local file system. In addition to archiving primary data in a central place to save space and avoid inconsistencies, such a database allows users to manage, search, and retrieve events across multiple datasets without reading the entire dataset. The database also provides infrastructure for handling more complex event patterns that include environmental and contextual conditions. The database can also be used as a cache for expensive intermediate results that are reused in such activities as cross-validation of machine learning algorithms. MOBBED is implemented over PostgreSQL, a widely used open source database, and is freely available under the GNU general public license at http://visual.cs.utsa.edu/mobbed.},

Despite representing less than 1\% of local neurons, these cholinergic cells have dominant control roles, exerting powerful modulation of circuit activity. Furthermore, these neurons could be activated by cocaine, and silencing this drug-induced activity during cocaine exposure (despite the fact that the manipulation of the cholinergic interneurons was not aversive by itself) blocked cocaine conditioning in freely moving mammals.},

Transcriptional circuits are layered by using promoters to carry the signal between circuits. In other words, the output promoter of one circuit serves as the input promoter to the next. Thus, connecting circuits requires physically connecting a promoter to the next circuit. We show that the sequence at the junction between the input promoter and circuit can affect the input-output response (transfer function) of the circuit. A library of putative sequences that might reduce (or buffer) such context effects, which we refer to as 'insulator parts', is screened in Escherichia coli. We find that ribozymes that cleave the 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the mRNA are effective insulators. They generate quantitatively identical transfer functions, irrespective of the identity of the input promoter. When these insulators are used to join synthetic gene circuits, the behavior of layered circuits can be predicted using a mathematical model. The inclusion of insulators will be critical in reliably permuting circuits to build different programs.},

	abstract = {Background 
Since the first deep brain stimulation (DBS) performed for movement disorder more than a decade ago, DBS has become a standard operation for advanced Parkinson's disease. Its indications are expanding to areas of dystonia, psychiatric conditions and refractory epilepsy. Additionally, a new set of DBS-related complications have arisen. Many teams found a slow learning curve from this complication-prone operation. We would like to investigate complications arising from 100 DBS electrode insertions and its prevention. 
Methods 
We performed an audit in all DBS patients for operation-related complications in our centre from 1997 to 2008. Complications were classified into operation-related, hardware-related and stimulation-related. Operation-related complications included intracranial haemorrhages and electrode malposition. Hardware-related complications included fracture of electrodes, electrode migration, infection and erosion. Stimulation-related complications included sensorimotor conditions, psychiatric conditions and life-threatening conditions. 
Results 
From 1997 to the end of 2008, 100 DBS electrodes were inserted in 55 patients for movement disorders, mostly for Parkinson's disease (50 patients). There was one symptomatic cerebral haemorrhage (1\%) and two electrode malpositions (2\%). Meticulous surgical planning, use of microdriver and a reliable electrode anchorage device would minimise this group of complications. There were two electrode fractures, one electrode migration and one pulse-generator infection which contributed to the hardware-related complication rate of 5\%. There was no sensorimotor or life-threatening complications in our group. However, three patients suffered from reversible psychiatric symptoms after DBS. 
Conclusion 
DBS is, on the one hand, an effective surgical treatment for movement disorders. On the other hand, it is a complication-prone operation. A dedicated “Movement Disorder Team” consisting of neurologists, neurophysiologists, functional neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists and nursing specialists is essential. Liaison among team members in perioperative periods and postoperative care is the key to avoiding complications and having a successful patient outcome.},

To this end we present a three-camera imaging microscope for fast tracking of multiple interacting molecules simultaneously, with high spatiotemporal resolution. The system was designed around an ASI RAMM frame using three separate tube lenses and custom multi-band dichroics to allow for enhanced detection efficiency. The frame times of the three Andor iXon Ultra EMCCD cameras are hardware synchronized to the laser excitation pulses of the three excitation lasers, such that the fluorophores are effectively immobilized during frame acquisitions and do not yield detections that are motion-blurred. Stroboscopic illumination allows robust detection from even rapidly moving molecules while minimizing bleaching, and since snapshots can be spaced out with varying time intervals, stroboscopic illumination enables a direct comparison to be made between fast and slow molecules under identical light dosage. We have developed algorithms that accurately track and co-localize multiple interacting biomolecules. The three-color microscope combined with our co-movement algorithms have made it possible for instance to simultaneously image and track how the chromosome environment affects diffusion kinetics or determine how mRNAs diffuse during translation. Such multiplexed single-molecule measurements at a high spatiotemporal resolution inside living cells will provide a major tool for testing models relating molecular architecture and biological dynamics.},

The measurement elements of an optical BCI consist of sets of optical sources and detectors. Our current system utilises sources which comprise of dual wavelength light emitting diodes (LED) at 760nm and 880nm. An optical analysis demonstrated that NIR radiation is a negligible source of heating in this case. LED heat conduction however is a major source of heating, and LEDs, though much safer than laser diodes, have been known to cause burns if improperly used. We describe a procedure by which we measure the heat conduction effect of LEDs. We show that the LED systems used in our current generation BCI produce safe levels of thermal energy and are within published safety levels.},

	abstract = {Background 
We investigated the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) for treatment refractory depression. 
Methods 
Fifteen patients with chronic, severe, highly refractory depression received open-label DBS at three collaborating clinical sites. Electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the VC/VS region. Stimulation was titrated to therapeutic benefit and the absence of adverse effects. All patients received continuous stimulation and were followed for a minimum of 6 months to longer than 4 years. Outcome measures included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale—24 item (HDRS), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Global Assessment of Function Scale (GAF). 
Results 
Significant improvements in depressive symptoms were observed during DBS treatment. Mean HDRS scores declined from 33.1 at baseline to 17.5 at 6 months and 14.3 at last follow-up. Similar improvements were seen with the MADRS (34.8, 17.9, and 15.7, respectively) and the GAF (43.4, 55.5, and 61.8, respectively). Responder rates with the HDRS were 40\% at 6 months and 53.3\% at last follow-up (MADRS: 46.7\% and 53.3\%, respectively). Remission rates were 20\% at 6 months and 40\% at last follow-up with the HDRS (MADRS: 26.6\% and 33.3\%, respectively). The DBS was well-tolerated in this group.

	abstract = {Automatic cell segmentation has various applications in cytometry, and while the nucleus is often very distinct and easy to identify, the cytoplasm provides a lot more challenge. A new combination of image analysis algorithms for segmentation of cells imaged by fluorescence microscopy is presented. The algorithm consists of an image pre\&\#x2010;processing step, a general segmentation and merging step followed by a segmentation quality measurement. The quality measurement consists of a statistical analysis of a number of shape descriptive features. Objects that have features that differ to that of correctly segmented single cells can be further processed by a splitting step. By statistical analysis we therefore get a feedback system for separation of clustered cells. After the segmentation is completed, the quality of the final segmentation is evaluated. By training the algorithm on a representative set of training images, the algorithm is made fully automatic for subsequent images created under similar conditions. Automatic cytoplasm segmentation was tested on CHO\&\#x2010;cells stained with calcein. The fully automatic method showed between 89\&\#x25; and 97\&\#x25; correct segmentation as compared to manual segmentation.},

	abstract = {Seizure control using deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides an alternative therapy to patients with intractable and drug resistant epilepsy. This paper presents novel DBS stimulus protocols to disrupt seizures. Two protocols are presented: open-loop stimulation and a closed-loop feedback system utilizing measured firing rates to adjust stimulus frequency. Stimulation suppression is demonstrated in a computational model using 3000 excitatory Morris–Lecar (M–L) model neurons connected with depressing synapses. Cells are connected using second order network topology (SONET) to simulate network topologies measured in cortical networks. The network spontaneously switches from tonic to clonic as synaptic strengths and tonic input to the neurons decreases. To this model we add periodic stimulation pulses to simulate DBS. Periodic forcing can synchronize or desynchronize an oscillating population of neurons, depending on the stimulus frequency and amplitude. Therefore, it is possible to either extend or truncate the tonic or clonic phases of the seizure. Stimuli applied at the firing rate of the neuron generally synchronize the population while stimuli slightly slower than the firing rate prevent synchronization. We present an adaptive stimulation algorithm that measures the firing rate of a neuron and adjusts the stimulus to maintain a relative stimulus frequency to firing frequency and demonstrate it in a computational model of a tonic-clonic seizure. This adaptive algorithm can affect the duration of the tonic phase using much smaller stimulus amplitudes than the open-loop control.},

While the HRME platform has recently gained popularity as a simple alternative to confocal endomicroscopy, the axial response of HRME in thick, scattering tissue has yet to be described quantitatively. These details are important because when analyzing images collected by HRME, out-of-focus light may affect the accuracy of quantitative parameters such as nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio, which has been proposed as a diagnostic indicator of dysplasia or cancer. In this study we investigated the imaging properties of the HRME system by using phantoms simulating scattering tissue with fluorescently labeled nuclei. We directly compared HRME imaging with confocal endomicroscopy in phantoms and in vivo human tissue. HRME images defocused (deep) objects with apparent diameters and intensity levels that are in agreement with a simple geometric model. Out-of-focus nuclei contribute a relatively low, uniform background level to images which neither leads to the erroneous appearance of large nuclei from deep layers, nor prevents accurate imaging of superficial nuclei with high contrast.},

	abstract = {Neural activity manifests itself as complex spatiotemporal activation patterns in cell populations. Even for local neural circuits, a comprehensive description of network activity has been impossible so far. Here we demonstrate that two-photon calcium imaging of bulk-labeled tissue permits dissection of local input and output activities in rat neocortex in vivo. Besides astroglial and neuronal calcium transients, we found spontaneous calcium signals in the neuropil that were tightly correlated to the electrocorticogram. This optical encephalogram (OEG) is shown to represent bulk calcium signals in axonal structures, thus providing a measure of local input activity. Simultaneously, output activity in local neuronal populations could be derived from action potential-evoked calcium transients with single-spike resolution. By using these OEG and spike activity measures, we characterized spontaneous activity during cortical Up states. We found that (i) spiking activity is sparse ({\textless}0.1 Hz); (ii) on average, only ≈10\% of neurons are active during each Up state; (iii) this active subpopulation constantly changes with time; and (iv) spiking activity across the population is evenly distributed throughout the Up-state duration. Furthermore, the number of active neurons directly depended on the amplitude of the OEG, thus optically revealing an input-output function for the local network. We conclude that spontaneous activity in the neocortex is sparse and heterogeneously distributed in space and time across the neuronal population. The dissection of the various signal components in bulk-loaded tissue as demonstrated here will enable further studies of signal flow through cortical networks.},

Investigation of such interactions could benefit from closed-loop experimental protocols in which one stream can be controlled depending on the state of the other. We describe here methods to present rapid and precisely timed visual stimuli to awake animals, conditional on features of the animal's on-going brain state; those features are the presence, power and phase of oscillations in local field potentials (LFP). The system can process up to 64 channels in real time. We quantified its performance using simulations, synthetic data and animal experiments (chronic recordings in the dorsal cortex of awake turtles). The delay from detection of an oscillation to the onset of a visual stimulus on an LCD screen was 47.5 ms and visual-stimulus onset could be locked to the phase of ongoing oscillations at any frequency ≤40 Hz. Our software's architecture is flexible, allowing on-the-fly modifications by experimenters and the addition of new closed-loop control and analysis components through plugins.

The microfluidic device, which is a novel free-standing multifunctional pipette, allows diverse superfusion experiments, such as testing the effects of different concentrations of drugs or drug candidates on neurons in different cell layers with high positional accuracy, affecting only a small number of cells. We demonstrate herein the use of the method with electrophysiological recordings of pyramidal cells in hippocampal and prefrontal cortex brain slices from rats, determine the dependence of electric responses on the distance of the superfusion device from the recording site, document a multifold gain in solution exchange time as compared to whole slice perfusion, and show that the device is able to store and deliver up to four solutions in a series. Localized solution delivery by means of open-volume microfluidic technology also reduces reagent consumption and tissue culture expenses significantly, while allowing more data to be collected from a single tissue slice, thus reducing the number of laboratory animals to be sacrificed for a study.},

DBS devices in the era were based on cardiac pacing technology but were greatly modified in implementation due to the unique needs of DBS. Clinical studies in the 1970s and early 1980s have revealed a technique with modest results which did not lead to regulatory approval for the treatment of pain. In the 1980s a new application for DBS emerged in the treatment of movement disorders. Clinical trials confirmed the robustness of the therapy leading to approvals by regulatory authorities in the US and Europe for the treatment of tremor and the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Technology based on that used for earlier clinical research in pain was improved by leveraging advances in cardiac pacing technology resulting in the sophisticated and reliable systems available today. In the 1990s scientific exploration began in the treatment of psychiatric disorders which is ongoing today. Simultaneously, studies into the treatment of epilepsy were begun which resulted in regulatory approval in Europe. Suggestions have been made to expand these scientific explorations to other central nervous system dysfunctions. Opportunity remains to improve the technology including individualized and symptom specific stimulation patterns, more physician and patient friendly programming, and possibly closed-loop systems for more situation dependent and effective therapy.},

Despite well established clinical efficacy, the mechanism(s) of DBS remains poorly understood. In this review we begin by summarizing the current understanding of the DBS mechanism. Using this knowledge as a framework, we then explore a specific hypothesis regarding DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for the treatment of PD. This hypothesis states that therapeutic benefit is provided, at least in part, by activation of surviving nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, subsequent striatal dopamine release, and resumption of striatal target cell control by dopamine. While highly controversial, we present preliminary data that are consistent with specific predications testing this hypothesis. We additionally propose that developing new technologies, e.g., human electrometer and closed-loop smart devices, for monitoring dopaminergic neurotransmission during STN DBS will further advance this treatment approach.},

	abstract = {Neurophenomenology is a scientific research program aimed to combine neuroscience with phenomenology in order to study human experience. Nevertheless, despite several explicit implementations, the integration of first-person data into the experimental protocols of cognitive neuroscience still faces a number of epistemological and methodological challenges. Notably, the difficulties to simultaneously acquire phenomenological and neuroscientific data have limited its implementation into research projects. In our paper, we propose that neurofeedback paradigms, in which subjects learn to self-regulate their own neural activity, may offer a pragmatic way to integrate first-person and third-person descriptions. Here, information from first- and third-person perspectives is braided together in the iterative causal closed loop, creating experimental situations in which they reciprocally constrain each other. In real-time, the subject is not only actively involved in the process of data acquisition, but also assisted to directly influence the neural data through conscious experience. Thus, neurofeedback may help to gain a deeper phenomenological-physiological understanding of downward causations whereby conscious activities have direct causal effects on neuronal patterns. We discuss possible mechanisms that could mediate such effects and indicate a number of directions for future research.},

There was significant (90\%) attenuation of the light intensity for both 488 nm and 633 nm at a distance of 2.5 mm from the intracerebral laser light-emitting source. At greater distances from the light-emitting source that corresponded to areas in the cerebral cortex, there was greater attenuation of light intensity for increasing distance with 488 nm than with 633 nm because of the increased vascularity of the cortical mantle and absorption of 488 nm by hemoglobin. When hematoporphyrin derivative was given intravascularly, there was increased attenuation of 633 nm through the cerebral cortex that was similar to that seen for 488 nm in normals. Direct assessment of light intensity in living tissue, which we have shown is possible in this report, will aid in our understanding and interpretation of the histological changes that occur following photodynamic therapy.},

Having earlier adapted a light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), for allowing neurons to be stimulated by blue light, we searched for a complementary tool that would enable optical neuronal inhibition, driven by light of a second color. Here we report that targeting the codon-optimized form of the light-driven chloride pump halorhodopsin from the archaebacterium Natronomas pharaonis (hereafter abbreviated Halo) to genetically-specified neurons enables them to be silenced reliably, and reversibly, by millisecond-timescale pulses of yellow light. We show that trains of yellow and blue light pulses can drive high-fidelity sequences of hyperpolarizations and depolarizations in neurons simultaneously expressing yellow light-driven Halo and blue light-driven ChR2, allowing for the first time manipulations of neural synchrony without perturbation of other parameters such as spiking rates. The Halo/ChR2 system thus constitutes a powerful toolbox for multichannel photoinhibition and photostimulation of virally or transgenically targeted neural circuits without need for exogenous chemicals, enabling systematic analysis and engineering of the brain, and quantitative bioengineering of excitable cells.},

We report a scalable method to monolithically integrate microscopic light emitting diodes (μLEDs) and recording sites onto silicon neural probes for optogenetic applications in neuroscience. Each μLED and recording site has dimensions similar to a pyramidal neuron soma, providing confined emission and electrophysiological recording of action potentials and local field activity. We fabricated and implanted the four-shank probes, each integrated with 12 μLEDs and 32 recording sites, into the CA1 pyramidal layer of anesthetized and freely moving mice. Spikes were robustly induced by 60 nW light power, and fast population oscillations were induced at the microwatt range. To demonstrate the spatiotemporal precision of parallel stimulation and recording, we achieved independent control of distinct cells ∼50 μm apart and of differential somato-dendritic compartments of single neurons. The scalability and spatiotemporal resolution of this monolithic optogenetic tool provides versatility and precision for cellular-level circuit analysis in deep structures of intact, freely moving animals.},

	abstract = {Interstitial flow is the convective transport of fluid through tissue extracellular matrix. This creeping fluid flow has been shown to affect the morphology and migration of cells such as fibroblasts, cancer cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. A microfluidic cell culture system was designed to apply stable pressure gradients and fluid flow and allow direct visualization of transient responses of cells seeded in a 3D collagen type I scaffold. We used this system to examine the effects of interstitial flow on cancer cell morphology and migration and to extend previous studies showing that interstitial flow increases the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-435S melanoma cells [Shields J, et al. (2007) Cancer Cell 11:526–538]. Using a breast carcinoma line (MDA-MB-231) we also observed cell migration along streamlines in the presence of flow; however, we further demonstrated that the strength of the flow as well as the cell density determined directional bias of migration along the streamline. In particular, we found that cells either at high seeding density or with the CCR-7 receptor inhibited migration against, rather than with the flow. We provide further evidence that CCR7-dependent autologous chemotaxis is the mechanism that leads to migration with the flow, but also demonstrate a competing CCR7-independent mechanism that causes migration against the flow. Data from experiments investigating the effects of cell concentration, interstitial flow rate, receptor activity, and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation support our hypothesis that the competing stimulus is integrin mediated. This mechanism may play an important role in development of metastatic disease.},

The immune deficiency component of these diseases is less severe than that of the severe T-cell immunodeficiencies and therefore some ability to respond to infectious organisms is retained. Unlike severe T-cell immunodeficiencies, however, partial immunodeficiencies are commonly associated with hyper-immune dysregulation, including autoimmunity, inflammatory diseases and elevated IgE production. This causative association is counter-intuitive — immune deficiencies are caused by loss-of-function changes to the T-cell component, whereas the coincident autoimmune symptoms are the consequence of gain-of-function changes. This Review details the genetic basis of partial T -cell immunodeficiencies and draws on recent advances in mouse models to propose mechanisms by which a reduction in T-cell numbers or function may disturb the population-dependent balance between activation and tolerance.},

Here we introduce a miniature (1.9 g) integrated fluorescence microscope made from mass-producible parts, including a semiconductor light source and sensor. This device enables high-speed cellular imaging across {\textasciitilde}0.5 mm2 areas in active mice. This capability allowed concurrent tracking of Ca2+ spiking in {\textgreater}200 Purkinje neurons across nine cerebellar microzones. During mouse locomotion, individual microzones exhibited large-scale, synchronized Ca2+ spiking. This is a mesoscopic neural dynamic missed by prior techniques for studying the brain at other length scales. Overall, the integrated microscope is a potentially transformative technology that permits distribution to many animals and enables diverse usages, such as portable diagnostics or microscope arrays for large-scale screens.},

We review the most well known algorithms for constructing networks with given non-homogeneous statistical properties and provide simple pseudo-code for reproducing such networks in software simulations. We also review some useful mathematical results and approximations associated with the statistics that describe these network models, including degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient. We demonstrate how such results can be used as partial verification and validation of implementations. Finally, we discuss a sometimes overlooked modeling choice that can be crucially important for the properties of simulated networks: that of network directedness. The most well known network algorithms produce undirected networks, and we emphasize this point by highlighting how simple adaptations can instead produce directed networks.},

Theoretical perspectives are given for the acquisition models indicating that the animal models are valid predictors of human ­behavior. Common organismic factors that contribute to the acquisition of drug abuse are also discussed, such as sex, hormonal influences, innate preference for sweet substances, impulsivity of choice, impaired inhibition, and avidity for physical activity. Differential rates of acquisition of drug SA in rats selectively bred for high and low sweet intake, ethanol intake, or avoidance responding are also discussed. Environmental factors such as enriched versus impoverished conditions, and the effect of behavioral economic factors related to drug abuse (e.g., effort, cost/reinforcement) are also considered. Pharmacological factors have also been found to influence acquisition, such as prenatal exposure to drugs, and potential treatment drug can reduce the rates of acquisition in animal models. Interrelations among factors are described, and their implications are summarized. This review adds to previous accounts of acquisition by shifting the emphasis from analysis of the process of acquisition of drug-taking to an assessment of the major factors that are influential in the initiation and acceleration of this process. The goal is to present translatable findings from animal research that are useful for informing prevention of drug abuse in humans.},

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapy to treat movement disorders including essential tremor, dystonia, and Parkinson's disease. Despite over a decade of clinical experience the mechanisms of DBS are still unclear, and this lack of understanding makes the selection of stimulation parameters quite challenging. The objective of this work was to develop a closed-loop control system that automatically adjusted the stimulation amplitude to reduce oscillatory neuronal activity, based on feedback of electrical signals recorded from the brain using the same electrode as implanted for stimulation. We simulated a population of 100 intrinsically active model neurons in the Vim thalamus, and the local field potentials (LFPs) generated by the population were used as the feedback (control) variable for closed loop control of DBS amplitude. Based on the correlation between the spectral content of the thalamic activity and tremor (Hua , 1998), (Lenz , 1988), we implemented an adaptive minimum variance controller to regulate the power spectrum of the simulated LFPs and restore the LFP power spectrum present under tremor conditions to a reference profile derived under tremor free conditions. The controller was based on a recursively identified autoregressive model (ARX) of the relationship between stimulation input and LFP output, and showed excellent performances in tracking the reference spectral features through selective changes in the theta (2-7 Hz), alpha (7-13 Hz), and beta (13-35 Hz) frequency ranges. Such changes reflected modifications in the firing patterns of the model neuronal population, and, differently from open-loop DBS, replaced the tremor-related pathological patterns with patterns similar to those simulated in tremor-free conditions. The closed-loop controller generated a LFP spectrum that approximated more closely the spectrum present in the tremor-free condition than did open loop fixed intensity stimulation and adapted to match the spectrum afte- - r a change in the neuronal oscillation frequency. This computational study suggests the feasibility of closed-loop control of DBS amplitude to regulate the spectrum of the local field potentials and thereby normalize the aberrant pattern of neuronal activity present in tremor.},

In single patients with a cerebral aneurysm an external ventricular drain (EVD), an intracranial pressure (ICP) gauge or a combined EVD and ICP gauge placement is necessary after coil embolization and initiation of postprocedural anticoagulation. The aim of this study was to examine the hemorrhage rates of drain placement within 48h after aneurysm coiling and under anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed hemorrhage rates of EVD, ICP gauge or combined EVD and ICP gauge placement in 27 patients within 48h after coil embolization under different anticoagulation or antiplatelet schemes (heparin, acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel). In patients with continuous heparin via perfusor the application was stopped periprocedurally. The results were compared to literature.
Results
Four hemorrhages (14.8\%) were observed. Three hemorrhages were petechial and one was by definition a larger hemorrhage with 8mm×10mm in diameter.
Conclusions
EVD, ICP gauge or combined EVD and ICP gauge placements within 48h after cerebral aneurysm coiling and under different anticoagulation or antiplatelet regimens seem to have no increased risk of hemorrhages compared to literature.},

At its core, impulsivity arises through an inability to adequately suppress or inhibit inappropriate behaviour and by a general intolerance to delayed gratification, a tendency also widely found in abstinent drug addicts. Despite intensive research, however, it remains unclear whether impulsivity arises from neural abnormalities produced by the chronic exposure of individuals to drugs such as alcohol and cocaine (‘state impulsivity’) potentially via interactions with medial temporal lobe and frontal cortical structures (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex) or whether instead ‘trait impulsivity’ and brain disorders linked to it – for example, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) – predispose to drug use and addiction. This chapter considers both possibilities from a neural systems and psychological perspective drawing on evidence from animal models and clinical research.},

This paper reviews how well people are able to make such judgments, the evidence for individual signs of intoxication, several structured rating techniques, and the use of sobriety tests. It is concluded that observers relying on common-sense clues of intoxication have limited ability to assess the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels of strangers, particularly below .10\%. This generalization holds across professions that might be expected to show greater accuracy. Structured assessment instruments based on observable signs have shown promise but are confounded by the wide variations between casual social drinkers and those that have obtained a high level of tolerance. Among sobriety tests, only NHTSA's Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) have substantial, but seriously flawed, research support. Assessing the sobriety of strangers in the low to moderate BAC ranges without resort to chemical tests remains a daunting task. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Many variations of the self-administration procedure have been developed to model specific aspects of drug abuse, to assess the rewarding effects of drugs, and to assess the effects of treatments. The chapter describes how these variations are devised by stipulating the behavioral requirements for receiving the drug (i.e., the schedule of reinforcement) and incorporating drug-related environmental cues analogous to those that occur in the human drug-abuse environment.},

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven to be a successful therapeutic approach in several patients with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Hitherto its application was mainly restricted to advanced disease patients resistant to medication or with severe treatment side effects. However, there is now growing interest in earlier application of DBS, aimed at improving clinical outcomes, quality of life, and avoiding psychosocial consequences of chronic disease-related impairments. We address the clinical and ethical aspects of two “early” uses of DBS, (1) DBS early in the course of the disease, and (2) DBS early in life (i.e. in children). Possible benefits, risks and burdens are discussed and thoroughly considered. Further research is needed to obtain a careful balance between exposing vulnerable patients to potential severe surgical risks and excluding them from a potentially good outcome.},

	abstract = {Investigators that require the chronic implantation of hardware on the non-human primate skull are often challenged with the possible failure of head implants. To improve the success rate of our head implants, titanium anchor screws, referred to as titanium endosseous implants, were implanted in the skulls of six macaques. Techniques adapted from the processing of dentures were utilized to pre-fabricate an acrylic ‘skull cap’, which provided the mechanical support structure for our study-specific hardware. A two-stage procedure adapted from dentistry (Brånemark et al., 1977) was employed for the placement of titanium endosseous implants in the skull. This two-stage technique incorporates the principles of osseointegration and a healing period. Of the six skull-anchored implants prepared implementing the methods described in this paper, we have not experienced any failures. Additionally, all of the titanium endosseous implants examined post mortem were functionally successful (n=30). Histology results confirmed that there was healthy bone in direct contact with the titanium endosseous implants. The dense cortical bone of the macaque skull is ideal for the implantation of titanium endosseous implants. Titanium endosseous implants have provided secure, functional anchor points for the attachment of hardware to the macaque skull and have resulted in healthy, stable head implants that can remain on the skull for extended periods of time.},

They expand the possibilities of noninvasive analysis and have many useful properties, making them potential candidates for numerous novel applications. Notably, they have been shown that they can be tracked by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and are capable of conjugation with various cell types, including stem cells. In-depth research has been undertaken to establish these benefits, so that a deeper level of understanding of stem cell migratory pathways and differentiation, tumor migration, and improved drug delivery can be achieved. Stem cells have the ability to treat and cure many debilitating diseases with limited side effects, but a main problem that arises is in the noninvasive tracking and analysis of these stem cells. Recently, researchers have acknowledged the use of SPIONs for this purpose and have set out to establish suitable protocols for coating and attachment, so as to bring MRI tracking of SPION-labeled stem cells into common practice. This review paper explains the manner in which SPIONs are produced, conjugated, and tracked using MRI, as well as a discussion on their limitations. A concise summary of recently researched magnetic particle coatings is provided, and the effects of SPIONs on stem cells are evaluated, while animal and human studies investigating the role of SPIONs in stem cell tracking will be explored.Keywords: stem cells, nanoparticle, magnetic},

In such a system, a feedback signal is used to adjust automatically stimulation parameters and optimize the efficacy of stimulation. We explored the feasibility of recording electrically evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) during DBS for use as a feedback control signal. A novel instrumentation system was developed to suppress the stimulus artifact and amplify the small magnitude, short latency ECAP response during DBS with clinically relevant parameters. In vitro testing demonstrated the capabilities to increase the gain by a factor of 1,000x over a conventional amplifier without saturation, reduce distortion of mock ECAP signals, and make high fidelity recordings of mock ECAPs at latencies of only 0.5 ms following DBS pulses of 50 to 100 μs duration. Subsequently, the instrumentation was used to make in vivo recordings of ECAPs during thalamic DBS in cats, without contamination by the stimulus artifact. The signal characteristics were similar across three experiments, suggesting common neural activation patterns. The ECAP recordings enabled with this novel instrumentation may provide insight into the type and spatial extent of neural elements activated during DBS, and could serve as feedback control signals for closed-loop systems.},

	abstract = {Major impediments to technology scaling in the nanometer regime include power (or energy) dissipation and "erroneous" behavior induced by process variations and noise susceptibility. In this paper, we demonstrate that CMOS devices whose behavior is rendered probabilistic by noise (yielding probabilistic CMOS or PCMOS) can be harnessed for ultra low energy and high performance computation. PCMOS devices are inherently probabilistic in that they are guaranteed to compute correctly with a probability 1/2 {\textless} p {\textless} 1 and thus, by design, they are expected to compute incorrectly with a probability (1 - p). In this paper, we show that PCMOS technology yields significant improvements, both in the energy consumed as well as in the performance, for probabilistic applications with broad utility. These benefits are derived using an application-architecture-technology (A2T) co-design methodology introduced here, yielding an entirely novel family of probabilistic system-on-a-chip (PSOC) architectures. All of our application and architectural savings are quantified using the product of the energy and the performance denoted (energy x performance): the PCMOS based gains are as high as a substantial multiplicative factor of over 560 when compared to a competing energy-efficient CMOS based realization.},

In order to facilitate a wider adoption of these methods, neuroscientific research needs to ensure a maximum of transparency to allow for comprehensive evaluation of the employed procedures. We argue that such transparency requires “neuroscience-aware” technology for the performance of multivariate pattern analyses of neural data that can be documented in a comprehensive, yet comprehensible way. Recently, we introduced PyMVPA, a specialized Python framework for machine learning based data analysis that addresses this demand. Here, we review its features and applicability to various neural data modalities.},

Fluence rates are measured using calibrated isotropic probes that are positioned stereotactically. Mathematical models are then used to derive tissue optical properties, enabling calculation of fluence rate distributions for general tumor and light application geometries. The fluence rates in tumor-free brains agree well with the models based on diffusion theory and Monte Carlo simulation. In both cases, the best fit is found for absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of 0.57 and 28cm−1, respectively. In brains with implanted BT4C tumors, a discrepancy between diffusion and Monte Carlo–derived two-layer models is noted. Both models suggest that tumor tissue has higher absorption and less scattering than normal brain. Temperatures are measured by inserting thermocouples directly into tumor-free brains. A model based on diffusion theory and the bioheat equation is found to be in good agreement with the experimental data and predict a thermal penetration depth of 0.60cm in normal rat brain. The predicted parameters can be used to estimate the fluences, fluence rates, and temperatures achieved during photodynamic therapy.},

To this date, very few studies have tried to integrate third-person data, or data about the neurophysiological correlates of conscious states, with first-person data, or data about subjective experience. Inspired by Morel's invention (Casares, 1940), a literary machine capable of reproducing sensory-dependent external reality, this article suggests that combination of virtual reality techniques and brain reading technologies, that is, decoding of conscious states by brain activity alone, can offer this integration. It is also proposed that the multimodal, simulating, and integrative capacities of the dreaming brain render it an “endogenous” Morel's machine, which can potentially be used in studying consciousness, but not always in a reliable way. Both the literary machine and dreaming could contribute to a better understanding of conscious states.},

	abstract = {Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that control the movement of ions across the cell membrane. They are the molecular machines that make neurons excitable by enabling the initiation and propagation of action potentials (APs). Rapid signaling within and between neurons requires complex molecular processes that couple the sensing of membrane voltage or neurotransmitter release to the fast opening and closing of the ion channel gate. Malfunction of an ion channel's sensing or gating module can have disastrous pathological consequences. However, linking molecular changes to the modulation of neural circuits and ultimately to a physiological or pathological state is not a straightforward task. It requires precise and sophisticated methods of controlling the function of ion channels in their native environment. To address this issue we have developed new photochemical tools that enable the remote control of neuronal ion channels with light. Due to its optical nature, our approach permits the manipulation of the nervous system with high spatial, temporal and molecular precision that will help us understand the link between ion channel function and physiology. In addition, this strategy may also be used in the clinic for the direct treatment of some neuronal disorders.},

Thus, the creation of behavioral paradigms has been slowed by the intricacy of the coding required and their dissemination across labs has been hampered by the various types of hardware needed.

	abstract = {Based on the observation of a high incidence of breast cancer in the upper outer quadrant adjacent to the usual area of application of deodorants and/or antiperspirants, several scientific teams have advanced the hypothesis of a possible link between antiperspirants and breast cancer. The possibility of the involvement of parabens and aluminium salts, traditional components of a number of cosmetic products, has been advanced by the same teams. In order to ascertain whether this hypothesis could or could not be confirmed, a group of clinical experts in oncology was set up to search and analyse the literature data relating to the problem raised with the aim of answering three predefined questions: 1) does it exist experimental or biological arguments supporting a potential link between the use of deodorants/antiperspirants and breast cancer? 2) Does the use of deodorants/antiperspirants have any effect on the increase in the risk of breast cancer? 3) Could a causal relationship between the use of deodorants/antiperspirants and breast cancer be accepted? The scientific data were searched systematically in the PubMed database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez) using standardised search equations. Fifty-nine studies resulting from the literature search were reviewed and nineteen articles with various methodologies were selected for in-depth analysis. In view of the fact that parabens are generally not present in deodorants/antiperspirants, the reflection group's search related purely to the question of aluminium salts. Among these nineteen articles, many are methodologically unsound, do not answer to the questions posed or deal with the question of parabens and were therefore discarded by the reflection group. The expert group's conclusion coincides with those of the French, European and American health authorities. After analysis of the available literature on the subject, no scientific evidence to support the hypothesis was identified and no validated hypothesis appears likely to open the way to interesting avenues of research.},

Additional narrow-band filters will also become available as required. An Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) detector is employed for both optical channels, each capable of simultaneously delivering sub-electron effective read noise under multiplication gain and frame rates of up to 26 fps full frame (several 1000 fps windowed), over a fully corrected 5 x 5 arcmin field of view. CHIMERA was primarily developed to enable the characterization of the size distribution of sub-km Kuiper Belt Objects via stellar occultation, a science case that motivates the frame-rate, the simultaneous multi-color imaging and the wide field of view of the instrument. In addition, it also has unique capability in the detection of faint near-Earth asteroids and will be used for the monitoring of short duration transient and periodic sources, particularly those discovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), and the upcoming Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).},

	abstract = {Objective:  
  A prevalence of at least 30\% for treatment-resistant depression has prompted the investigation of alternative treatment strategies. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising targeted approach involving the bilateral placement of electrodes at specific neuroanatomical sites. Given the invasive and experimental nature of DBS for treatment-resistant depression, it is important to obtain both short-term and long-term effectiveness and safety data. This report represents an extended follow-up of 20 patients with treatment-resistant depression who received DBS to the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (Brodmann's area 25).Method:  
  After an initial 12-month study of DBS, patients were seen annually and at a last follow-up visit to assess depression severity, functional outcomes, and adverse events.Results:  
  The average response rates 1, 2, and 3 years after DBS implantation were 62.5\%, 46.2\%, and 75\%, respectively. At the last follow-up visit (range=3—6 years), the average response rate was 64.3\%. Functional impairment in the areas of physical health and social functioning progressively improved up to the last follow-up visit. No significant adverse events were reported during this follow-up, although two patients died by suicide during depressive relapses.Conclusions:  
  These data suggest that in the long term, DBS remains a safe and effective treatment for treatment-resistant depression. Additional trials with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.Abstract Teaser},

	abstract = {Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are powerful tools for systems neuroscience. Here we describe red, single-wavelength GECIs, “RCaMPs,” engineered from circular permutation of the thermostable red fluorescent protein mRuby. High-resolution crystal structures of mRuby, the red sensor RCaMP, and the recently published red GECI R-GECO1 give insight into the chromophore environments of the Ca2+-bound state of the sensors and the engineered protein domain interfaces of the different indicators. We characterized the biophysical properties and performance of RCaMP sensors in vitro and in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila larvae, and larval zebrafish. Further, we demonstrate 2-color calcium imaging both within the same cell (registering mitochondrial and somatic [Ca2+]) and between two populations of cells: neurons and astrocytes. Finally, we perform integrated optogenetics experiments, wherein neural activation via channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or a red-shifted variant, and activity imaging via RCaMP or GCaMP, are conducted simultaneously, with the ChR2/RCaMP pair providing independently addressable spectral channels. Using this paradigm, we measure calcium responses of naturalistic and ChR2-evoked muscle contractions in vivo in crawling C. elegans. We systematically compare the RCaMP sensors to R-GECO1, in terms of action potential-evoked fluorescence increases in neurons, photobleaching, and photoswitching. R-GECO1 displays higher Ca2+ affinity and larger dynamic range than RCaMP, but exhibits significant photoactivation with blue and green light, suggesting that integrated channelrhodopsin-based optogenetics using R-GECO1 may be subject to artifact. Finally, we create and test blue, cyan, and yellow variants engineered from GCaMP by rational design. This engineered set of chromatic variants facilitates new experiments in functional imaging and optogenetics.},

	abstract = {Neuromodulation (deep brain stimulation; DBS) has become an established treatment for movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease), and is in trials for refractory epilepsy, headache, and certain mood disorders. Two main themes will advance DBS significantly in the next five years: closed-loop DBS, that is, feedback from brain electrical activity to direct the stimulation; and computational analysis (CA)—electrophysiological modeling to enhance DBS. Closed-loop DBS is currently in clinical trials for refractory epilepsy. New imaging techniques offer preoperative modeling for DBS surgery, including nerve fiber tracts (diffusion tensor imaging), and imaging of volume of tissue activated by a specific electrode. CA techniques for DBS include mathematical models of the abnormally synchronized electrical activity which underlies epilepsy, movement disorders, and likely many mood disorders as well. By incorporating feedback loops and multiple recording and/or stimulating sites, the abnormally synchronized brain electrical activity can be desynchronized, then “unlearned” (“unkindling” in epilepsy). Characteristics of DBS utilizing CA include low frequency rather than high frequency stimulation; multiple stimulation and/or recording sites; likely 10-fold or more reduction in electrical current needs (much smaller “pulse generators”); more focused and less disruptive stimulation—fewer unwanted side effects; and potential to “cure” certain disorders by resetting abnormal firing patterns back to normal. These advantages of more sophisticated DBS techniques bring the following challenges, which may require a decade of research before reaching clinical practice because many brain disorders involve neurotransmitter abnormalities (e.g., dopamine in Parkinson's disease and certain mood disorders). Namely, how do we monitor and modulate neurotransmitters in addition to electrical activity? How do we get multiple microelectrodes into the brain in a minimally invasive manner? In the accompanying article, I address these two issues and offer some potential solutions.},

Current methodologies are based on decoding the motor intent from the recorded neural activity and transforming the extracted information into motor commands to control external devices as robotic arms. We developed a novel computational approach, based on the concept of programming dynamical behaviors trough the bi-directional sensory-motor interaction between the brain and the connected external device. This approach is based on the emulation of some control features of a biological interface, the spinal cord. The first prototype of our interface controls the state of motion of a simulated point mass in a viscous medium. The position of the point mass is encoded into a stimulus to the somatosensory cortex of an anesthetized rat. The evoked activity of a population of motor cortical neurons is decoded into a force vector applied to the point mass. The parameters of the encoder and of the decoder are set to approximate a desired force field. In the first test of the interface, we obtained a family of trajectories that converged upon a stable attractor.},

The state-of-the art single-wavelength GECI, GCaMP3, has been deployed in a number of model organisms and can reliably detect three or more action potentials in short bursts in several systems in vivo. Through protein structure determination, targeted mutagenesis, high-throughput screening, and a battery of in vitro assays, we have increased the dynamic range of GCaMP3 by severalfold, creating a family of “GCaMP5” sensors. We tested GCaMP5s in several systems: cultured neurons and astrocytes, mouse retina, and in vivo in Caenorhabditis chemosensory neurons, Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction and adult antennal lobe, zebrafish retina and tectum, and mouse visual cortex. Signal-to-noise ratio was improved by at least 2- to 3-fold. In the visual cortex, two GCaMP5 variants detected twice as many visual stimulus-responsive cells as GCaMP3. By combining in vivo imaging with electrophysiology we show that GCaMP5 fluorescence provides a more reliable measure of neuronal activity than its predecessor GCaMP3. GCaMP5 allows more sensitive detection of neural activity in vivo and may find widespread applications for cellular imaging in general.},

	abstract = {We present a structured matrix factorization approach to analyzing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal ensembles. Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity of each neuron from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. The matrix factorization approach relies on the observation that the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity can be expressed as a product of two matrices: a spatial matrix that encodes the location of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. We present a simple approach for estimating the dynamics of the calcium indicator as well as the observation noise statistics from the observed data. These parameters are then used to set up the matrix factorization problem in a constrained form that requires no further parameter tuning. We discuss initialization and post-processing techniques that enhance the performance of our method, along with efficient and largely parallelizable algorithms.

Whereas the wide variety of involuntary behaviors (and here mostly the deviant or pathological ones will be considered) will necessarily be represented at some biophysical level in nervous system activity–for after all those cellular activity patterns manifest themselves as behaviors and thus there will be a multiplicity of them–there could be some general tendencies to be discerned amongst that assortment. Collecting observations derived from neurophysiological activity associated with several pathological conditions characterized by presenting will-less actions such as Parkinson's disease, seizures, alien hand syndrome and tics, it is proposed that a general neurophysiologic tendency of brain activity that correlates with involuntary actions is higher than normal synchrony in specific brain cell networks, depending upon the behavior in question. Wilful, considered normal behavior, depends on precise coordination of the collective activity in cell ensembles that may be lost, or diminished, when there are tendencies toward more than normal or aberrant synchronization of cellular activity. Hence, rapid fluctuations in synchrony is associated with normal actions and cognition while less variability in brain recordings particularly with regards to synchronization could be a signature of unconscious and deviant behaviors in general.},

We readily obtained images of vasculature filled with fluorescently labeled blood and of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons filled with a calcium indicator. Capillary blood flow and dendritic calcium transients were measured with high time resolution using line scans.

The main difficulty in its practical application to spike train analysis is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a systematic error (called “bias”). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a real experiment. In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek procedures, and a recently proposed shuffling bias reduction procedure. Finally, we make practical recommendations for the accurate computation of information from spike trains. Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text. This provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of possible discrete neuronal responses.},

Technologies that enable temporally precise control of electrical activity of specific neurons, and not these neurons’ neighbors — whose cell bodies or processes might be just tens to hundreds of nanometers away — must involve two components. First, they require as a trigger a transient pulse of energy that supports the temporal precision of the control. Second, they require a molecular sensitizer that can be expressed in specific neurons and which renders those neurons specifically responsive to the triggering energy delivered. Optogenetic tools, such as microbial opsins, can be used to activate or silence neural activity with brief pulses of light. Thermogenetic tools, such as thermosensitive TRP channels, can be used to drive neural activity downstream of increases or decreases in temperature. We here discuss the principles underlying the operation of these two recently developed, but widely used, toolboxes, as well as the directions being taken in the use and improvement of these toolboxes.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to evaluate hydroxyapatite paste (BoneSource; Leibinger Corp., Dallas, TX) as an alloplastic implant for supraorbital and malar augmentation. Ten male Sprague-Dawley rats had cylindrical onlay implants made of the hydroxyapatite cement placed above their left orbits on the supraorbital rim. Size-matched Medpor implants were placed similarly on the right side. To test the utility of this new material in the midface, hydroxyapatite paste and Medpor implants were also placed in the right malar regions of a different set of rats. The implants were left in situ for 6 months and examined for evidence of bone ingrowth, infection, migration, resorption, and detrimental effects on the surrounding tissue. All hydroxyapatite cement implants provided excellent soft tissue projection and demonstrated steadfast adherence to the adjacent bone. The surface of the hydroxyapatite implant in contact with the native bone demonstrated evidence of native bony ingrowth into approximately 12\% of the implant. There was no evidence of implant migration or gross infection. There was no bony resorption below the hydroxyapatite paste, but four of the Medpor implants showed evidence of this in the underlying bone. Only one negative aspect to the use of hydroxyapatite cement paste as an onlay implant was identified. Two of the supraorbital and one of the malar hydroxyapatite implants had approximately 20 to 25\% volume loss during the experimental period (P = 0.05). Overall, the vast majority of the implants retained their original form. We concluded that hydroxyapatite paste may possibly be used to effectively augment bone in the supraorbital and malar regions. Its biocompatibility, excellent bony adherence, and tendency to be replaced by natural bone may make it suitable for the aesthetic patient. The possible resorptive aspects of the material need to be evaluated further.},

The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion.

TDT is written in Matlab and equipped with an interface to the widely used brain data analysis package SPM. The toolbox allows running fast whole-brain analyses, region-of-interest analyses and searchlight analyses, using machine learning classifiers, pattern correlation analysis, or representational similarity analysis. It offers automatic creation and visualization of diverse cross-validation schemes, feature scaling, nested parameter selection, a variety of feature selection methods, multiclass capabilities, and pattern reconstruction from classifier weights. While basic users can implement a generic analysis in one line of code, advanced users can extend the toolbox to their needs or exploit the structure to combine it with external high-performance classification toolboxes. The toolbox comes with an example data set which can be used to try out the various analysis methods. Taken together, TDT offers a promising option for researchers who want to employ multivariate analyses of brain activity patterns.},

	abstract = {A major characteristic of neural networks is the complexity of their organization at various spatial scales, from microscopic local circuits to macroscopic brain-scale areas. Understanding how neural information is processed thus entails the ability to study them at multiple scales simultaneously. This is made possible using microelectrodes array (MEA) technology. Indeed, high-density MEAs provide large-scale coverage (several square millimeters) of whole neural structures combined with microscopic resolution (about 50 μm) of unit activity. Yet, current options for spatiotemporal representation of MEA-collected data remain limited. Here we present NeuroMap, a new interactive Matlab-based software for spatiotemporal mapping of MEA data. NeuroMap uses thin plate spline interpolation, which provides several assets with respect to conventional mapping methods used currently. First, any MEA design can be considered, including 2D or 3D, regular or irregular, arrangements of electrodes. Second, spline interpolation allows the estimation of activity across the tissue with local extrema not necessarily at recording sites. Finally, this interpolation approach provides a straightforward analytical estimation of the spatial Laplacian for better current sources localization. In this software, coregistration of 2D MEA data on the anatomy of the neural tissue is made possible by fine matching of anatomical data with electrode positions using rigid-deformation-based correction of anatomical pictures. Overall, NeuroMap provides substantial material for detailed spatiotemporal analysis of MEA data.

We have placed great emphasis on the development of behavioral procedures whereby animals not only self-administer drugs, but pathologically seek and take drugs in a way that resembles the clinical condition in human drug addicts. Thus, over the last 10 years we have developed models in rats that specifically address the development of habitual drug seeking behavior, compulsive cocaine seeking and taking behavior, and even addiction-like behavior. In this chapter, we review the behavioral procedures, namely second-order schedules of reinforcement, two-link heterogeneous chained schedules of reinforcement and the “three addiction-like behavioral criteria selection procedure” that we have used in rats to model habitual drug seeking behavior, compulsive drug seeking and taking behavior and addiction-like behavior. Although not yet widely adopted, these models have already contributed to the identification of some neurobiological and psychological mechanisms involved in the vulnerability to drug addiction and the transition from controlled to compulsive drug use, thereby emphasizing their great heuristic value in attempts to understand drug addiction.},

	abstract = {Neurofeedback (NFB) is emerging as a promising technique that enables self-regulation of ongoing brain oscillations. However, despite a rise in empirical evidence attesting to its clinical benefits, a solid theoretical basis is still lacking on the manner in which NFB is able to achieve these outcomes. The present work attempts to bring together various concepts from neurobiology, engineering, and dynamical systems so as to propose a contemporary theoretical framework for the mechanistic effects of NFB. The objective is to provide a firmly neurophysiological account of NFB, which goes beyond traditional behaviorist interpretations that attempt to explain psychological processes solely from a descriptive standpoint whilst treating the brain as a “black box”. To this end, we interlink evidence from experimental findings that encompass a broad range of intrinsic brain phenomena: starting from “bottom-up” mechanisms of neural synchronization, followed by “top-down” regulation of internal brain states, moving to dynamical systems plus control-theoretic principles, and concluding with activity-dependent as well as homeostatic forms of brain plasticity. In support of our framework, we examine the effects of NFB in several brain disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In sum, it is argued that pathological oscillations emerge from an abnormal formation of brain-state attractor landscape(s). The central thesis put forward is that NFB tunes brain oscillations toward a homeostatic set-point which affords an optimal balance between network flexibility and stability (i.e., self-organised criticality (SOC)).},

We mapped multi-unit activity and LFP visual responses with sparse-noise at several cortical sites simultaneously. The cortical magnification factor near the recording sites was precisely estimated by track reconstruction. The new method combined experimental measurements together with a model of signal summation to obtain the cortical spread of the LFP. This new method could be extended to cortical areas that have topographic maps such as S1 or A1, and to cortical areas without functional columnar maps, such as rodent visual cortex. In macaque V1, the LFP was the sum of signals from a very local region, the radius of which was on average 250 μm. The LFP’s cortical spread varied across cortical layers, reaching a minimum value of 120 μm in layer 4B. An important functional consequence of the small cortical spread of the LFP is that the visual field maps of LFP and MUA recorded at a single electrode site were very similar. The similar spatial scale of the visual responses, the restricted cortical spread, and their laminar variation led to new insights about the sources and possible applications of the LFP.},

	abstract = {We investigated the use of flavoprotein autofluorescence (FA) as a tool to map long-range neural connections and combined FA with laser-uncaging of glutamate to facilitate rapid long-range mapping in vitro. Using the somatosensory thalamocortical slice, we determined that the spatial resolution of FA is ≥100–200 μm and that the sensitivity for detecting thalamocortical synaptic activity approximates that of whole cell recording. Blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors with DNQX and AP5 abolished cortical responses to electrical thalamic stimulation. The combination of FA with photostimulation using caged glutamate revealed robust long-distance connectivity patterns that could be readily assessed in slices from the somatosensory, auditory, and visual systems that contained thalamocortical, corticothalamic, or corticocortical connections. We mapped the projection from theventral posterior nucleus of thalamus (VPM) to the primary somatosensory cortex-barrel field and confirmed topography that had been previously described using more laborious methods. We also produced a novel map of the projections from the VPM to the thalamic reticular nucleus, showing precise topography along the dorsoventral axis. Importantly, only about 30 s were needed to generate the connectivity map (six stimulus locations). These data suggest that FA is a sensitive tool for exploring and measuring connectivity and, when coupled with glutamate photostimulation, can rapidly map long-range projections in a single animal.},

Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work. Achieving the full potential of massively parallel neuronal recordings, however, will require further development of the neuron–electrode interface, automated and efficient spike-sorting algorithms for effective isolation and identification of single neurons, and new mathematical insights for the analysis of network properties.},

	abstract = {Sarcoidosis is likely to result from exposure of genetically susceptible hosts to environmental agents. Erythrocyte (E) complement receptor 1 (CR1) is a membrane protein mediating the transport of immune complexes (ICs) to phagocytes, and at least three polymorphisms on the CR1 gene are related to erythrocyte surface density of CR1 molecules, in turn related to the rate of IC clearance from circulation. We hypothesized that sarcoidosis could be associated with increased frequency of the CR1 gene alleles coding for reduced CR1/E ratio. We studied 91 sarcoid patients and two control groups: 94 healthy volunteers and 71 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Three polymorphic sites of CR1 gene, His1208Arg, intron 27 HindIII/RFLP, and Pro1827Arg, were analyzed. The three polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium. The GG genotype for the Pro1827Arg (C(5507)G) polymorphism was significantly associated with sarcoidosis in comparison to both control groups (odds ratio [OR] = 3.13; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.49-6.69 versus healthy control subjects, and OR= 2.82, 95\% CI 1.27-6.39 versus COPD control subjects). The same genotype was particularly associated to disease in females (OR = 7.05; 95\% CI 3.10-16.61 versus healthy control subjects). These findings agree with speculations on the role of CR1 gene as a possible susceptibility factor.},

	abstract = {Metadata providing information about the stimulus, data acquisition, and experimental conditions are indispensable for the analysis and management of experimental data within a lab. However, only rarely are metadata available in a structured, comprehensive, and machine-readable form. This poses a severe problem for finding and retrieving data, both in the laboratory and on the various emerging public data bases. Here, we propose a simple format, the “open metaData Markup Language” (odML), for collecting and exchanging metadata in an automated, computer-based fashion. In odML arbitrary metadata information is stored as extended key–value pairs in a hierarchical structure. Central to odML is a clear separation of format and content, i.e., neither keys nor values are defined by the format. This makes odML flexible enough for storing all available metadata instantly without the necessity to submit new keys to an ontology or controlled terminology. Common standard keys can be defined in odML-terminologies for guaranteeing interoperability. We started to define such terminologies for neurophysiological data, but aim at a community driven extension and refinement of the proposed definitions. By customized terminologies that map to these standard terminologies, metadata can be named and organized as required or preferred without softening the standard. Together with the respective libraries provided for common programming languages, the odML format can be integrated into the laboratory workflow, facilitating automated collection of metadata information where it becomes available. The flexibility of odML also encourages a community driven collection and definition of terms used for annotating data in the neurosciences.},

This paper presents a comparative study of the usage of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the naive Bayes (NB) classifiers on describing both right- and left-hand movement through electroencephalographic signal (EEG) acquisition. For the analysis, we considered the following input features: the energy of the segments of a band pass-filtered signal with the frequency band in sensorimotor rhythms and the components of the spectral energy obtained through the Welch method. We also used the common spatial pattern (CSP) filter, so as to increase the discriminatory activity among movement classes. By using the database generated by this experiment, we obtained hit rates up to 70\%. The results are compatible with previous studies.},

Appropriate dural healing is crucial to prevent CSF leaks but the entire process has been barely understood so far. Here, we review the impact of growth factors and chemotherapeutic agents on an explant culture of human dural fibroblasts and a 3D subculture grown in a collagen mesh scaffold.
METHODS: Human dural specimens were harvested during surgical procedures where they would not be further used therapeutically or diagnostically. Explant cultures were grown in Petri dishes, and subcultures were grown in collagen mesh scaffolds. Insulin, fibroblast growth factor type 2 (FGF-2), and human serum were analyzed for their effect as growth factors, whereas mitomycin C, vincristine, and colchicine were analyzed for their role as inhibitors. Cell count was used as a parameter to assess the effects of these factors. In addition, the effects of human serum were assessed using collagen mesh scaffolds.
RESULTS: Insulin, FGF-2, and human serum increased culture cell count; human serum also achieved an increased number of viable fibroblasts embedded in a collagen mesh. Mitomycin C, which is a mitosis inhibitor, showed no significant effect on cell count, whereas colchicine and vincristine, which inhibit both mitosis and migration, resulted in cell growth suppression.
DISCUSSION: In our model, dural defect closure is achieved through cell migration rather than through cell growth. Adding growth factors to the dural suture line or into a collagen mesh might prove useful to stimulate dural closure.},

	abstract = {It was postulated that the perceived association of visual features is based on the synchronization of those neural signals that are activated by a coherent visual object. Two types of synchronized cortical signals were found by us in cat and monkey visual cortex, and were proposed as candidates for feature association: (1) stimulus-locked signals, evoked by transient retinal stimulation, and typically non-rhythmic; (2) oscillatory signals, induced by sustained stimuli, and typically not locked in their oscillation phases to stimulus events. Both types of signals can occur synchronously in those neurons that are activated by a common stimulus. Synchronized activities were found in paired recordings within vertical cortex columns, in separate columns of the same cortical area, and even between different cortical areas or hemispheres. The average phase difference between such common oscillatory events was typically close to zero ({\textless} 1 msec mean +/- 2 msec S.D.). For the dependence of synchronization from stimulus and receptive field properties, a preliminary 'rule' can be given: the coherence of fast oscillations in separate cortical assemblies depends inversely on the 'coding distance' between the assemblies' RF properties, but directly on the degree of overlap between the assemblies' respective coding properties and the features of a common stimulus. This means that oscillatory events in any two assemblies, in the same or in different cortical areas or hemispheres, are more closely correlated the more similar are their receptive field properties, and the better a common stimulus activates the assemblies simultaneously. Our results can explain some neural mechanisms of perceptual feature-linking, including mutual enhancement among similar, spatially and temporally dispersed features, definitions of spatial and temporal continuity, scene segmentation, and figure-ground discrimination. We further propose that mutual enhancement and synchronization of cell activities are general principles of temporal coding by assemblies, that are also used within and among other sensory modalities as well as between cortical sensory and motor systems.},

	abstract = {An important issue for neurophysiological studies of the visual system is the definition of the region of the visual field that can modify a neuron's activity (i.e., the neuron's receptive field – RF). Usually a trade-off exists between precision and the time required to map a RF. Manual methods (qualitative) are fast but impose a variable degree of imprecision, while quantitative methods are more precise but usually require more time. We describe a rapid quantitative method for mapping visual RFs that is derived from computerized tomography and named back-projection. This method finds the intersection of responsive regions of the visual field based on spike density functions that are generated over time in response to long bars moving in different directions. An algorithm corrects the response profiles for latencies and allows for the conversion of the time domain into a 2D-space domain. The final product is an RF map that shows the distribution of the neuronal activity in visual–spatial coordinates. In addition to mapping the RF, this method also provides functional properties, such as latency, orientation and direction preference indexes. This method exhibits the following beneficial properties: (a) speed; (b) ease of implementation; (c) precise RF localization; (d) sensitivity (this method can map RFs based on few responses); (e) reliability (this method provides consistent information about RF shapes and sizes, which will allow for comparative studies); (f) comprehensiveness (this method can scan for RFs over an extensive area of the visual field); (g) informativeness (it provides functional quantitative data about the RF); and (h) usefulness (this method can map RFs in regions without direct retinal inputs, such as the cortical representations of the optic disc and of retinal lesions, which should allow for studies of functional connectivity, reorganization and neural plasticity). Furthermore, our method allows for precise mapping of RFs in a 30° by 30° area of the visual field for an array of microelectrodes of any size in less than 6 min.},

Currently, anatomical data from over 100 Cre driver lines are publicly available via the Allen Institute’s Transgenic Characterization database, which can be used to assist researchers in choosing the appropriate Cre drivers for functional, molecular, or connectional studies of different regions and/or cell types in the brain.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) include stimulators, infusion devices, and neuroprostheses. They all belong to functional neurosurgery. Deep brain stimulators (DBS) are widely used for therapy and are in need of innovative evolutions. Robotized exoskeletons require BCIs able to drive up to 26 degrees of freedom (DoF). We report the nanomicrotechnology development of prototypes for new 3D DBS and for motor neuroprostheses. For this complex project, all compounds have been designed and are being tested. Experiments were performed in rats and primates for proof of concepts and development of the electroencephalogram (EEG) recognition algorithm.
METHODS: Various devices have been designed. (A) In human, a programmable multiplexer connecting five tetrapolar (20 contacts) electrodes to one DBS channel has been designed and implanted bilaterally into STN in two Parkinsonian patients. (B) A 50-mm diameter titanium implant, telepowered, including a radioset, emitting ECoG data recorded by a 64-electrode array using an application-specific integrated circuit, is being designed to be implanted in a 50-mm trephine opening. Data received by the radioreceiver are processed through an original wavelet-based Iterative N-way Partial Least Square algorithm (INPLS, CEA patent). Animals, implanted with ECoG recording electrodes, had to press a lever to obtain a reward. The brain signature associated to the lever press (LP) was detected online by ECoG processing using INPLS. This detection allowed triggering the food dispenser.
RESULTS: (A) The 3D multiplexer allowed tailoring the electrical field to the STN. The multiplication of the contacts affected the battery life and suggested different implantation schemes. (B) The components of the human implantable cortical BCI are being tested for reliability and toxicology to meet criteria for chronicle implantation in 2012. (C) In rats, the algorithm INPLS could detect the cortical signature with an accuracy of about 80\% of LPs on the electrodes with the best correlation coefficient (located over the cerebellar cortex), 1\% of the algorithm decisions were false positives. We aim to pilot effectors with DoF up to 3 in monkeys.
CONCLUSION: We have designed multielectrodes wireless implants to open the way for BCI ECoG-driven effectors. These technologies are also used to develop new generations of brain stimulators, either cortical or for deep targets. This chapter is aimed at illustrating that BCIs are actually the daily background of DBS, that the evolution of the method involves a growing multiplicity of targets and indications, that new technologies make possible and simpler than before to design innovative solutions to improve DBS methodology, and that the coming out of BCI-driven neuroprostheses for compensation of motor and sensory deficits is a natural evolution of functional neurosurgery.},

By using a dedicated CMOS image sensor, we have successfully imaged and measured brain serine protease activity in vivo, in real-time, and for an extended period of time. We have developed a biofluorescence imaging device by packaging the CMOS image sensor which enabled on-chip imaging configuration. In this configuration, no optics are required whereby an excitation filter is applied onto the sensor to replace the filter cube block found in conventional fluorescence microscopes. The fully packaged device measures 350 μm thick × 2.7 mm wide, consists of an array of 176 × 144 pixels, and is small enough for measurement inside a single hemisphere of the mouse brain, while still providing sufficient imaging resolution. In the experiment, intraperitoneally injected kainic acid induced upregulation of serine protease activity in the brain. These events were captured in real time by imaging and measuring the fluorescence from a fluorogenic substrate that detected this activity. The entire device, which weighs less than 1\% of the body weight of the mouse, holds promise for studying freely moving animals.},

	abstract = {Local and superficial near-infrared (NIR) optical-property characterization of turbid biological tissues can be achieved by measurement of spatially resolved diffuse reflectance at small source–detector separations ({\textless}1.4 mm). However, in these conditions the inverse problem, i.e., calculation of localized absorption and the reduced scattering coefficients, is necessarily sensitive to the scattering phase function. This effect can be minimized if a new parameter of the phase function γ, which depends on the first and the second moments of the phase function, is known. If γ is unknown, an estimation of this parameter can be obtained by the measurement, but the uncertainty of the absorption coefficient is increased. A spatially resolved reflectance probe employing multiple detector fibers (0.3–1.4 mm from the source) is described. Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine γ, the reduced scattering and absorption coefficients from reflectance data. Probe performance is assessed by measurements on phantoms, the optical properties of which were measured by other techniques [frequency domain photon migration (FDPM) and spatially resolved transmittance]. Our results show that changes in the absorption coefficient, the reduced scattering coefficient, and γ can be measured to within ∓0.005 mm−1, ∓0.05 mm−1, and ∓0.2, respectively. In vivo measurements performed intraoperatively on a human skull and brain are reported for four NIR wavelengths (674, 811, 849, 956 nm) when the spatially resolved probe and FDPM are used. The spatially resolved probe shows optimum measurement sensitivity in the measurement volume immediately beneath the probe (typically 1 mm3 in tissues), whereas FDPM typically samples larger regions of tissues. Optical-property values for human skull, white matter, scar tissue, optic nerve, and tumors are reported that show distinct absorption and scattering differences between structures and a dependence on the phase-function parameter γ.},

Typically, laser speckle contrast imaging is performed using scientific-grade instrumentation. However, due to recent advances in camera technology, these expensive components may not be necessary to produce accurate images. In this paper, we demonstrate that a consumer-grade webcam can be used to visualize changes in flow, both in a microfluidic flow phantom and in vivo in a mouse model. A two-camera setup was used to simultaneously image with a high performance monochrome CCD camera and the webcam for direct comparison. The webcam was also tested with inexpensive aspheric lenses and a laser pointer for a complete low-cost, compact setup (\$90, 5.6 cm length, 25 g). The CCD and webcam showed excellent agreement with the two-camera setup, and the inexpensive setup was used to image dynamic blood flow changes before and after a targeted cerebral occlusion.},

A target image in a sequence of nontarget distractor images elicits in the EEG a stereotypical spatiotemporal response, which can be detected. A pattern classifier uses this response to reprioritize the image sequence, placing detected targets in the front of an image stack. We use single-trial analysis based on linear discrimination to recover spatial components that reflect differences in EEG activity evoked by target versus nontarget images. We find an optimal set of spatial weights for 59 EEG sensors within a sliding 50-ms time window. Using this simple classifier allows us to process EEG in real time. The detection accuracy across five subjects is on average 92\%, i.e., in a sequence of 2500 images, resorting images based on detector output results in 92\% of target images being moved from a random position in the sequence to one of the first 250 images (first 10\% of the sequence). The approach leverages the highly robust and invariant object recognition capabilities of the human visual system, using single-trial EEG analysis to efficiently detect neural signatures correlated with the recognition event.},

Here we introduce a modular and extensible software architecture with a multi-threaded signal processing pipeline suitable for BCI applications. The computational load and latency (the time that the system needs to react to user input) are measured for different pipeline implementations in typical BCI applications with realistic parameter settings. We show that BCIs can benefit substantially from the proposed parallelization: firstly, by reducing the latency and secondly, by increasing the amount of recording channels and signal features that can be used for decoding beyond the amount which can be handled by a single thread. The proposed software architecture provides a simple, yet flexible solution for BCI applications.},

	abstract = {Epithelial cancers account for substantial mortality and are an important public health concern. With the need for earlier detection and treatment of these malignancies, the ability to accurately detect precancerous lesions has an increasingly important role in controlling cancer incidence and mortality. New optical technologies are capable of identifying early pathology in tissues or organs in which cancer is known to develop through stages of dysplasia, including the esophagus, colon, pancreas, liver, bladder, and cervix. These diagnostic imaging advances, together as a field known as optical endomicroscopy, are based on confocal microscopy, spectroscopy-based imaging, and optical coherence tomography (OCT), and function as "optical biopsies," enabling tissue pathology to be imaged in situ and in real time without the need to excise and process specimens as in conventional biopsy and histopathology. Optical biopsy techniques can acquire high-resolution, cross-sectional images of tissue structure on the micron scale through the use of endoscopes, catheters, laparoscopes, and needles. Since the inception of these technologies, dramatic technological advances in accuracy, speed, and functionality have been realized. The current paradigm of optical biopsy, or single-area, point-based images, is slowly shifting to more comprehensive microscopy of larger tracts of mucosa. With the development of Fourier-domain OCT, also known as optical frequency domain imaging or, more recently, volumetric laser endomicroscopy, comprehensive surveillance of the entire distal esophagus is now achievable at speeds that were not possible with conventional OCT technologies. Optical diagnostic technologies are emerging as clinically useful tools with the potential to set a new standard for real-time diagnosis. New imaging techniques enable visualization of high-resolution, cross-sectional images and offer the opportunity to guide biopsy, allowing maximal diagnostic yields and appropriate staging without the limitations and risks inherent with current random biopsy protocols. However, the ability of these techniques to achieve widespread adoption in clinical practice depends on future research designed to improve accuracy and allow real-time data transmission and storage, thereby linking pathology to the treating physician. These imaging advances are expected to eventually offer a see-and-treat paradigm, leading to improved patient care and potential cost reduction.

DBS is currently investigated in psychiatry for the treatment of refractory obsessive–compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome and depressive disorder. Although recent research in both animals and humans has indicated that DBS may be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction, it is not yet entirely clear which brain areas should be targeted. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature on DBS and addiction and outline the most promising target areas using efficacy and adverse event data from both preclinical and clinical studies. We found 7 animal studies targeting six different brain areas: nucleus accumbens (NAc), subthalamic nucleus (STN), dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hypothalamus, and 11 human studies targeting two different target areas: NAc and STN. Our analysis of the literature suggests that the NAc is currently the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. The mPFC is another promising target, but needs further exploration to establish its suitability for clinical purposes. We conclude the review with a discussion on translational issues in DBS research, medical ethical considerations and recommendations for clinical trials with DBS in patients with addiction.},

The recent development of neural photosensitization tools, such as channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), offers new opportunities for non-invasive, flexible and cell-specific neuronal stimulation. Previously, complex spatiotemporal control of photosensitized neurons has been limited by the lack of appropriate optical devices which can provide 2D stimulation with sufficient irradiance. Here we present a simple and powerful solution that is based on an array of high-power micro light-emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) that can generate arbitrary optical excitation patterns on a neuronal sample with micrometre and millisecond resolution. We first describe the design and fabrication of the system and characterize its capabilities. We then demonstrate its capacity to elicit precise electrophysiological responses in cultured and slice neurons expressing ChR2.},

Individual neurons had transient activation staggered relative to one another in time, forming a sequence of neuronal activation spanning the entire length of a task trial. Distinct sequences of neurons were triggered on trials with opposite behavioural choices and defined divergent, choice-specific trajectories through a state space of neuronal population activity. Cells participating in the different sequences and at distinct time points in the task were anatomically intermixed over microcircuit length scales ({\textless}100 micrometres). During working memory decision tasks, the PPC may therefore perform computations through sequence-based circuit dynamics, rather than long-lived stable states, implemented using anatomically intermingled microcircuits.},

We tested this possibility in cortical slices from mice, and found that exposure to blue light ([lambda] = 475 nm) derived from a 20 mW diode laser for 50 min suppresses trans-synaptic components of field potentials. This finding formed the basis of a transcranial photo-inactivation technique, that was used to investigate auditory signal transmission between the anterior auditory field (AAF) and the primary auditory cortex (AI) in anesthetized mice. Cortical responses in AAF and AI, elicited by 5 kHz tonal stimuli, were visualized using transcranial flavoprotein fluorescence imaging. After determining responsive areas in AAF and AI, the auditory cortex was exposed to the blue diode laser via the intact skull, while either AAF or AI was protected with a piece of carbon paper. Although the photo-inactivation of AI had no significant effect on the fluorescence responses in AAF, the photo-inactivation of AAF significantly reduced the fluorescence responses in AI, indicating the presence of auditory signal transmission from AAF to AI.},

	abstract = {The efficient transduction of postmitotic cells by adeno-associated virus (AAV) makes it an excellent vector to deliver marker, functional, or therapeutic genes to the mammalian brain. An attractive feature of AAV is that all the viral-coding sequences are removed when engineering the recombinant genome, thereby limiting the extent of cell toxicity and immune response that are often associated with viral gene transcription. Of the seven described AAV serotypes, AAV serotype-2 (AAV2) is the most studied gene-transfer vehicle for in the mammalian brain. A feature of AAV2 transduction in the brain is that the vector remains confined to the injection site and predominately infects neurons rather than glia (2-8). The limited diffusion of AAV2 vectors is beneficial for controlled gene delivery. For instance, targeting therapeutic genes only to brain structures showing pathology would eliminate complications associated with vector diffusion and subsequent expression in healthy structures, and is an important consideration when designing treatment strategies for localized neurodegenerative diseases. The same is true for other experimental paradigms, such as investigating the function of genes in specific brain structures or using marker genes in tract-tracing experiments. Although AAV2 vectors were shown to remain predominately at the injection site, one study demonstrated that the vector itself may undergo axonal transport in inter-regional systems (9).},

There are usually five elements within an image acquisition sub-system: light source, illumination optics, image-enhancement optics, main lens and sensor. The positions of these relative to each other and the object being observed must be carefully selected, to obtain a digital image that is easy to process electronically. The physical layout of the optical sub-system and the choice of appropriate components are of equal importance. Chapter 7 describes the light sources available, while optical components are discussed in Chaps. 5 and 6. Scanners and cameras and are described in Chaps. 9 and 10 respectively. Chapter 8 explains some of the concepts necessary to appreciate the methods described here. Of particular note is that of an illumination diagram. This explains, in graphical form, the shape and position and of the light source in relation to the widget and camera. Notice that the diagrams included in this chapter are not drawn to scale; they merely suggest a design for the lighting-viewing sub-system in broad conceptual terms. A multitude of combinations of the methods described below is possible.

When designing the image acquisition sub-system, a vision engineer should normally follows the following steps: Look at the widget In a darkened room, move a “point” light source round the widget. Rotate the widget as well. Watch the way that its appearance changes Repeat (a) using a broad light source (e.g., stand in front of a window). Ensure that no light falls on the widget from any other direction Bearing in mind the observations in step (1), consult the LVM Catalogue. Choose one or a few possible lighting-viewing methods Build a prototype lighting-viewing sub-system based on the idea(s) suggested by the catalogue Acquire some sample images Process these images using an interactive image processing system, such as QT (Chaps. 21 and 41) or Neat Vision (Chap. 22) Adjust the lighting-viewing sub-system and repeat steps (4) to (5), until satisfactory results are obtained Design and build the target system based on the prototype Step (1) is very simple, yet it is always in danger of being omitted. The phrase that summarises this design process is “Experiment, look and observe”. Over a period of many years, involving numerous applications, the author has found this procedure to be very effective indeed. Never attempt to design an image acquisition system without moving from the desk!.},

	abstract = {Active dendrites provide neurons with powerful processing capabilities. However, little is known about the role of neuronal dendrites in behaviourally related circuit computations. Here we report that a novel global dendritic nonlinearity is involved in the integration of sensory and motor information within layer 5 pyramidal neurons during an active sensing behaviour. Layer 5 pyramidal neurons possess elaborate dendritic arborizations that receive functionally distinct inputs, each targeted to spatially separate regions. At the cellular level, coincident input from these segregated pathways initiates regenerative dendritic electrical events that produce bursts of action potential output and circuits featuring this powerful dendritic nonlinearity can implement computations based on input correlation. To examine this in vivo we recorded dendritic activity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the barrel cortex using two-photon calcium imaging in mice performing an object-localization task. Large-amplitude, global calcium signals were observed throughout the apical tuft dendrites when active touch occurred at particular object locations or whisker angles. Such global calcium signals are produced by dendritic plateau potentials that require both vibrissal sensory input and primary motor cortex activity. These data provide direct evidence of nonlinear dendritic processing of correlated sensory and motor information in the mammalian neocortex during active sensation.},

In this protocol we describe a chronic cranial window to obtain optical access to the mouse cerebral cortex for long-term imaging. A small bone flap is replaced with a coverglass, which is permanently sealed in place with dental acrylic, providing a clear imaging window with a large field of view ({\textasciitilde}0.8–12 mm2). The surgical procedure can be completed within {\textasciitilde}1 h. The preparation allows imaging over time periods of months with arbitrary imaging intervals. The large size of the imaging window facilitates imaging of ongoing structural plasticity of small neuronal structures in mice, with low densities of labeled neurons.

	abstract = {Background
Changes in motivational processing may play a role in weight gain and other non-motor side effects in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated with deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.
Objective/hypothesis
We aimed to assess changes in aversive and appetitive motivational activation using modulation of the acoustic blink reflex (ABR) by rewarding and aversive stimuli.
Methods
ABR elicited during the viewing of erotic, food, aversive and neutral pictures was recorded in 11 off-medicated patients with the subthalamic stimulation switched ON and OFF, and in 11 control subjects.
Results
ABR to erotic stimuli was larger in patients in the ON compared to the OFF condition and controls (P \&lt; 0.01). Aversive stimuli caused a larger increase in the ABR in patients with the ON condition than in controls (P \&lt; 0.05). Additionally, we found a negative correlation of the ABR magnitude to food pictures in the ON condition with weight gain following subthalamic stimulation (P \&lt; 0.01, after adjustment to OFF condition).
Conclusions
Our results suggest that subthalamic stimulation affects motivational processing. Subthalamic stimulation may disturb appetitive engagement by erotic cues and increase aversive activation in PD patients. Additionally, postoperative weight gain may be related to changes in the processing of food cues due to subthalamic stimulation.},

Specific connectivity may be important for areal specialization, particularly in the mouse, where neighboring neurons are functionally diverse. To examine whether higher visual areas receive functionally specific input from primary visual cortex (V1), we used two-photon calcium imaging to measure responses of axons from V1 arborizing in three areas with distinct spatial and temporal frequency preferences. We found that visual preferences of presynaptic boutons in each area were distinct and matched the average preferences of recipient neurons. This specificity could not be explained by organization within V1 and instead was due to both a greater density and greater response amplitude of functionally matched boutons. Projections from a single layer (layer 5) and from secondary visual cortex were also matched to their target areas. Thus, transmission of specific information to downstream targets may be a general feature of cortico-cortical communication.},

This device is a modified version of the halo system that is used in humans for cervical traction and stabilization after spinal column injuries. This device consists of an aluminum halo with four titanium skull pins offset from the halo by aluminum posts. The titanium pins insert onto small segments of cranially reinforcing titanium plate, which are attached to the skull with titanium cortex screws. The surgery involves four scalp incisions, placement of the reinforcing plates, insertion of the pins for attachment of the halo, and incision closure. After the halo is attached, the animal's head can be fixed to a primate chair using a custom-built attachment arm that provides three degrees of adjustability for proper positioning during behavioral tasks. We have installed this device on two Macaque monkeys weighing 7 and 10 kg. The halos have been in place on these animals for up to 8 months without signs of discomfort or loss of fixation. Using this method of head fixation, we have been able to track the animals’ eye positions with an accuracy of less than two visual degrees while they perform behavioral tasks.},

	abstract = {Two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal responses is an increasingly accessible technology for probing population responses in cortex at single cell resolution, and with reasonable and improving temporal resolution. However, analysis of two-photon data is usually performed using ad-hoc solutions. To date, no publicly available software exists for straightforward analysis of stimulus-triggered two-photon imaging experiments. In addition, the increasing data rates of two-photon acquisition systems imply increasing cost of computing hardware required for in-memory analysis. Here we present a Matlab toolbox, "FocusStack", for simple and efficient analysis of two-photon calcium imaging stacks on consumer-level hardware, with minimal memory footprint. We also present a Matlab toolbox, "StimServer", for generation and sequencing of visual stimuli, designed to be triggered over a network link from a two-photon acquisition system. "FocusStack" is compatible out of the box with several existing two-photon acquisition systems, and is simple to adapt to arbitrary binary file formats. Analysis tools such as stack alignment for movement correction, automated cell detection and peri-stimulus time histograms are already provided, and further tools can be easily incorporated. Both packages are available as publicly-accessible source-code repositories.},

	abstract = {Motivation
Needle-based biopsy and local therapy of prostate cancer depend multimodal imaging for both target planning and needle guidance. The clinical process involves selection of target locations in a pre-operative image volume and registering these to an intra-operative volume. Registration inaccuracies inevitably lead to targeting error, a major clinical concern. The analysis of targeting error requires a large number of images with known ground truth, which has been infeasible even for the largest research centers.

Methods
We propose to generate realistic prostate imaging data in a controllable way, with known ground truth, by simulation of prostate size, shape, motion and deformation typically encountered in prostatic needle placement. This data is then used to evaluate a given registration algorithm, by testing its ability to reproduce ground truth contours, motions and deformations. The method builds on statistical shape atlas to generate large number of realistic prostate shapes and finite element modeling to generate high-fidelity deformations, while segmentation error is simulated by warping the ground truth data in specific prostate regions. Expected target registration error (TRE) is computed as a vector field.

Results
The simulator was configured to evaluate the TRE when using a surface-based rigid registration algorithm in a typical prostate biopsy targeting scenario. Simulator parameters, such as segmentation error and deformation, were determined by measurements in clinical images. Turnaround time for the full simulation of one test case was below 3 minutes. The simulator is customizable for testing, comparing, optimizing segmentation and registration methods and is independent of the imaging modalities used.},

	abstract = {The present study was aimed at developing a new strategy to design and anchor custom-fitted implants, consisting of a head fixation device and a chronic recording chamber, on the skull of adult macaque monkeys. This was done without the use of dental resin or orthopedic cement, as these modes of fixation exert a detrimental effect on the bone. The implants were made of titanium or tekapeek and anchored to the skull with titanium screws. Two adult macaque monkeys were initially implanted with the head fixation device several months previous to electrophysiological investigation, to allow optimal osseous-integration, including growth of the bone above the implant's footplate. In a second step, the chronic recording chamber was implanted above the brain region of interest. The present study proposes two original approaches for both implants. First, based on a CT scan of the monkey, a plastic replicate of the skull was obtained in the form of a 3D print, used to accurately shape and position the two implants. This would ensure a perfect match with the skull surface. Second, the part of the implants in contact with the bone was coated with hydroxyapatite, presenting chemical similarity to natural bone, thus promoting excellent osseous-integration. The longevity of the implants used here was 4 years for the head fixation device and 1.5 years for the chronic chamber. There were no adverse events and daily care was easy. This is clear evidence that the present implanting strategy was successful and provokes less discomfort to the animals.},

	abstract = {Background
Statistical inference of signals is key to understand fundamental processes in the neurosciences. It is essential to distinguish true from random effects. To this end, statistical concepts of confidence intervals, significance levels and hypothesis tests are employed. Bootstrap-based approaches complement the analytical approaches, replacing the latter whenever these are not possible.
New method
Block-bootstrap was introduced as an adaption of the ordinary bootstrap for serially correlated data. For block-bootstrap, the signals are cut into independent blocks, yielding independent samples. The key parameter for block-bootstrapping is the block length. In the presence of noise, naïve approaches to block-bootstrapping fail. Here, we present an approach based on block-bootstrapping which can cope even with high noise levels. This method naturally leads to an algorithm of block-bootstrapping that is immediately applicable to observed signals.
Results
While naïve block-bootstrapping easily results in a misestimation of the block length, and therefore in an over-estimation of the confidence bounds by 50\%, our new approach provides an optimal determination of these, still keeping the coverage correct.
Comparison with existing methods
In several applications bootstrapping replaces analytical statistics. Block-bootstrapping is applied to serially correlated signals. Noise, ubiquitous in the neurosciences, is typically neglected. Our new approach not only explicitly includes the presence of (observational) noise in the statistics but also outperforms conventional methods and reduces the number of false-positive conclusions.
Conclusions
The presence of noise has impacts on statistical inference. Our ready-to-apply method enables a rigorous statistical assessment based on block-bootstrapping for noisy serially correlated data.},

	abstract = {Commercially available data acquisition systems for multielectrode recording from freely moving animals are expensive, often rely on proprietary software, and do not provide detailed, modifiable circuit schematics. When used in conjunction with electrical stimulation, they are prone to prolonged, saturating stimulation artifacts that prevent the recording of short-latency evoked responses. Yet electrical stimulation is integral to many experimental designs, and critical for emerging brain-computer interfacing and neuroprosthetic applications. To address these issues, we developed an easy-to-use, modifiable, and inexpensive system for multielectrode neural recording and stimulation. Setup costs are less than US\$10,000 for 64 channels, an order of magnitude lower than comparable commercial systems. Unlike commercial equipment, the system recovers rapidly from stimulation and allows short-latency action potentials ({\textless}1 ms post-stimulus) to be detected, facilitating closed-loop applications and exposing neural activity that would otherwise remain hidden. To illustrate this capability, evoked activity from microstimulation of the rodent hippocampus is presented. System noise levels are similar to existing platforms, and extracellular action potentials and local field potentials can be recorded simultaneously. The system is modular, in banks of 16 channels, and flexible in usage: while primarily designed for in vivo use, it can be combined with commercial preamplifiers to record from in vitro multielectrode arrays. The system’s open-source control software, NeuroRighter, is implemented in C\#, with an easy-to-use graphical interface. As C\# functions in a managed code environment, which may impact performance, analysis was conducted to ensure comparable speed to C++ for this application. Hardware schematics, layout files, and software are freely available. Since maintaining wired headstage connections with freely moving animals is difficult, we describe a new method of electrode-headstage coupling using neodymium magnets.},

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a safe, effective, and reversible treatment for a number of movement disorders. This has prompted investigation of its use for other applications including psychiatric disorders. In recent years, DBS has been introduced for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which is characterized by recurrent unwanted thoughts or ideas (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in order to relieve these obsessions (compulsions). Abnormal activity in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum, and mediodorsal (MD) thalamus has been implicated in OCD. To this end a number of DBS targets including the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS), ventral caudate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus (STN), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been investigated for the treatment of OCD. Despite its efficacy and widespread use in movement disorders, the mechanism of DBS is not fully understood, especially as it relates to psychiatric disorders. While initially thought to create a functional lesion akin to ablative procedures, it is increasingly clear that DBS may induce clinical benefit through activation of axonal fibers spanning the CSTC circuits, alteration of oscillatory activity within this network, and/or release of critical neurotransmitters. In this article we review how the use of DBS for OCD informs our understanding of both the mechanisms of DBS and the circuitry of OCD. We review the literature on DBS for OCD and discuss potential mechanisms of action at the neuronal level as well as the broader circuit level.},

They can change their conformation from a resting state to a signalling state upon light absorption, which activates the G protein, thereby resulting in a signalling cascade that produces physiological responses. This process of capturing a photon and transforming it into a physiological response is known as phototransduction. Recent cloning techniques have revealed the rich and diverse nature of these molecules, found in organisms ranging from jellyfish to humans, functioning in visual and non-visual phototransduction systems and photoisomerases. Here we describe the diversity of these proteins and their role in phototransduction. Then we explore the molecular properties of opsins, by analysing site-directed mutants, strategically designed by phylogenetic comparison. This site-directed mutant approach led us to identify many key features in the evolution of the photoreceptor molecules. In particular, we will discuss the evolution of the counterion, the reduction of agonist binding to the receptor, and the molecular properties that characterize rod opsins apart from cone opsins. We will show how the advances in molecular biology and biophysics have given us insights into how evolution works at the molecular level.},

Its temporal and spatial specificity, combined with efficacy in manipulating neuronal activity, are especially useful in studying the behavior of awake behaving animals. Conventional optogenetics, however, requires the use of lasers and optic fibers, which can place considerable restrictions on behavior. Here we combined a wirelessly controlled interface and small implantable light-emitting diode (LED) that allows flexible and precise placement of light source to illuminate any brain area. We tested this wireless LED system in vivo, in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in striatonigral neurons expressing D1-like dopamine receptors. In all mice tested, we were able to elicit movements reliably. The frequency of twitches induced by high power stimulation is proportional to the frequency of stimulation. At lower power, contraversive turning was observed. Moreover, the implanted LED remains effective over 50 days after surgery, demonstrating the long-term stability of the light source. Our results show that the wireless LED system can be used to manipulate neural activity chronically in behaving mice without impeding natural movements.},

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between these two components transduces voltage changes into fluorescence changes, providing a signal for imaging electrical activity in genetically targeted cells. To improve hVoS signals, we systematically varied the optical properties, membrane targeting motifs, and linkages of fluorescent proteins to optimize the normalized fluorescence change (ΔF/F) and signal/noise ratio. The best results were obtained with cerulean fluorescent protein tagged N-terminally with a GAP43 motif and C-terminally with a truncated h-ras motif. With 100 mV steps in PC12 cells, this probe produced ΔF/F = 26\% (4 μM dipicrylamine), which was threefold greater than that obtained with the original farnesylated EGFP construct. We also obtained a fivefold greater signal/noise ratio, which was 70\% of a theoretical optimum. We designate this GAP43-CerFP-t-h-ras construct as hVoS 2.0. With the aid of a theoretical analysis, we estimated that hVoS 2.0 places its fluorophore ∼40 Å from the bilayer midplane. hVoS 2.0 performed well in cultured hippocampal neurons, where single action potentials produced clear fluorescence changes in a single trial. This improved probe should help investigators image voltage in genetically targeted neurons.},

The synapsins have been implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. They tether synaptic vesicles to actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, controlling the number of vesicles available for release at the nerve terminus. A growing body of evidence suggests that the synapsins play a broad role during neuronal development. They participate in the formation and maintenance of synaptic contacts among central neurons. In addition, each synapsin has a specific role during the elongation of undifferentiated processes and their posterior differentiation into axons and dendrites. In this review, we focus on these novel roles of synapsins during the early stages of development.},

	abstract = {The functions of synapsins were examined by characterizing the phenotype of mice in which all three synapsin genes were knocked out. Although these triple knock-out mice were viable and had normal brain anatomy, they exhibited a number of behavioral defects. Synaptic transmission was altered in cultured neurons from the hippocampus of knock-out mice. At excitatory synapses, loss of synapsins did not affect basal transmission evoked by single stimuli but caused a threefold increase in the rate of synaptic depression during trains of stimuli. This suggests that synapsins regulate the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles. This possibility was examined further by measuring synaptic vesicle density in living neurons transfected with green fluorescent protein-tagged synaptobrevin 2, a marker of synaptic vesicles. The relative amount of fluorescent synaptobrevin was substantially lower at synapses of knock-out neurons than of wild-type neurons. Electron microscopy also revealed a parallel reduction in the number of vesicles in the reserve pool of vesicles {\textgreater}150 nm away from the active zone at excitatory synapses. Thus, synapsins are required for maintaining vesicles in the reserve pool at excitatory synapses. In contrast, basal transmission at inhibitory synapses was reduced by loss of synapsins, but the kinetics of synaptic depression were unaffected. In these terminals, there was a mild reduction in the total number of synaptic vesicles, but this was not restricted to the reserve pool of vesicles. Thus, synapsins maintain the reserve pool of glutamatergic vesicles but regulate the size of the readily releasable pool of GABAergic vesicles.},

Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike---a feat that arguably no other image analysis package, commercial or open source, has yet achieved. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a unique community that spans the biological and physical sciences, making ImageJ an invaluable resource across countless disciplines. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. Due to these new and emerging challenges in scientific imaging, ImageJ at a critical development crossroads. We present ImageJ2, a total redesign of ImageJ offering a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. ImageJ2 provides a framework adaptable to future needs, enabling continued success and innovation.},

Although numerous commercial laser scanning microscopes exist, some of the more interesting and challenging applications demand custom design. A major impediment to custom design is the difficulty of building custom data acquisition hardware and writing the complex software required to run the laser scanning microscope.
RESULTS: We describe a simple, software-based approach to operating a laser scanning microscope without the need for custom data acquisition hardware. Data acquisition and control of laser scanning are achieved through standard data acquisition boards. The entire burden of signal integration and image processing is placed on the CPU of the computer. We quantitate the effectiveness of our data acquisition and signal conditioning algorithm under a variety of conditions. We implement our approach in an open source software package (ScanImage) and describe its functionality.
CONCLUSIONS: We present ScanImage, software to run a flexible laser scanning microscope that allows easy custom design.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11548-011-0636-7},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: A system architecture has been developed for integration of intraoperative 3D imaging [viz., mobile C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT)] with surgical navigation (e.g., trackers, endoscopy, and preoperative image and planning data). The goal of this paper is to describe the architecture and its handling of a broad variety of data sources in modular tool development for streamlined use of CBCT guidance in application-specific surgical scenarios.
METHODS: The architecture builds on two proven open-source software packages, namely the cisst package (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and 3D Slicer (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA), and combines data sources common to image-guided procedures with intraoperative 3D imaging. Integration at the software component level is achieved through language bindings to a scripting language (Python) and an object-oriented approach to abstract and simplify the use of devices with varying characteristics. The platform aims to minimize offline data processing and to expose quantitative tools that analyze and communicate factors of geometric precision online. Modular tools are defined to accomplish specific surgical tasks, demonstrated in three clinical scenarios (temporal bone, skull base, and spine surgery) that involve a progressively increased level of complexity in toolset requirements.
RESULTS: The resulting architecture (referred to as "TREK") hosts a collection of modules developed according to application-specific surgical tasks, emphasizing streamlined integration with intraoperative CBCT. These include multi-modality image display; 3D-3D rigid and deformable registration to bring preoperative image and planning data to the most up-to-date CBCT; 3D-2D registration of planning and image data to real-time fluoroscopy; infrared, electromagnetic, and video-based trackers used individually or in hybrid arrangements; augmented overlay of image and planning data in endoscopic or in-room video; and real-time "virtual fluoroscopy" computed from GPU-accelerated digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). Application in three preclinical scenarios (temporal bone, skull base, and spine surgery) demonstrates the utility of the modular, task-specific approach in progressively complex tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: The design and development of a system architecture for image-guided surgery has been reported, demonstrating enhanced utilization of intraoperative CBCT in surgical applications with vastly different requirements. The system integrates C-arm CBCT with a broad variety of data sources in a modular fashion that streamlines the interface to application-specific tools, accommodates distinct workflow scenarios, and accelerates testing and translation of novel toolsets to clinical use. The modular architecture was shown to adapt to and satisfy the requirements of distinct surgical scenarios from a common code-base, leveraging software components arising from over a decade of effort within the imaging and computer-assisted interventions community.},

To this purpose it is instrumental to establish a software base, which will grow toward a comprehensive free and open-source language of technical and scientific computing. Endeavors in this direction are met with an important obstacle. MATLAB((R)), the predominant computation tool in many fields of research, is a closed-source commercial product. To facilitate the transition to an open computation platform, we propose Open-source MATLAB((R))-to-Python Compiler (OMPC), a platform that uses syntax adaptation and emulation to allow transparent import of existing MATLAB((R)) functions into Python programs. The imported MATLAB((R)) modules will run independently of MATLAB((R)), relying on Python's numerical and scientific libraries. Python offers a stable and mature open source platform that, in many respects, surpasses commonly used, expensive commercial closed source packages. The proposed software will therefore facilitate the transparent transition towards a free and general open-source lingua franca for scientific computation, while enabling access to the existing methods and algorithms of technical computing already available in MATLAB((R)).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current software tools for electrophysiological experiments are limited in flexibility and rarely offer adequate support for advanced techniques such as dynamic clamp and hybrid experiments, which are therefore limited to laboratories with a significant expertise in neuroinformatics.
NEW METHOD: We have developed lcg, a software suite based on a command-line interface (CLI) that allows performing both standard and advanced electrophysiological experiments. Stimulation protocols for classical voltage and current clamp experiments are defined by a concise and flexible meta description that allows representing complex waveforms as a piece-wise parametric decomposition of elementary sub-waveforms, abstracting the stimulation hardware. To perform complex experiments lcg provides a set of elementary building blocks that can be interconnected to yield a large variety of experimental paradigms.
RESULTS: We present various cellular electrophysiological experiments in which lcg has been employed, ranging from the automated application of current clamp protocols for characterizing basic electrophysiological properties of neurons, to dynamic clamp, response clamp, and hybrid experiments. We finally show how the scripting capabilities behind a CLI are suited for integrating experimental trials into complex workflows, where actual experiment, online data analysis and computational modeling seamlessly integrate.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: We compare lcg with two open source toolboxes, RTXI and RELACS.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that lcg will greatly contribute to the standardization and reproducibility of both simple and complex experiments. Additionally, on the long run the increased efficiency due to a CLI will prove a great benefit for the experimental community.},

However, long-term analysis of human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic neurons in primate PD models has never been performed to our knowledge. Here we show that human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic progenitor cells survived and functioned as midbrain dopaminergic neurons in a primate model of PD (Macaca fascicularis) treated with the neurotoxin MPTP. Score-based and video-recording analyses revealed an increase in spontaneous movement of the monkeys after transplantation. Histological studies showed that the mature dopaminergic neurons extended dense neurites into the host striatum; this effect was consistent regardless of whether the cells were derived from patients with PD or from healthy individuals. Cells sorted by the floor plate marker CORIN did not form any tumours in the brains for at least two years. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography were used to monitor the survival, expansion and function of the grafted cells as well as the immune response in the host brain. Thus, this preclinical study using a primate model indicates that human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic progenitors are clinically applicable for the treatment of patients with PD.},

	volume = {8},
	issn = {1746-1596},
	doi = {10.1186/1746-1596-8-92},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital pathology images are increasingly used both for diagnosis and research, because slide scanners are nowadays broadly available and because the quantitative study of these images yields new insights in systems biology. However, such virtual slides build up a technical challenge since the images occupy often several gigabytes and cannot be fully opened in a computer's memory. Moreover, there is no standard format. Therefore, most common open source tools such as ImageJ fail at treating them, and the others require expensive hardware while still being prohibitively slow.
RESULTS: We have developed several cross-platform open source software tools to overcome these limitations. The NDPITools provide a way to transform microscopy images initially in the loosely supported NDPI format into one or several standard TIFF files, and to create mosaics (division of huge images into small ones, with or without overlap) in various TIFF and JPEG formats. They can be driven through ImageJ plugins. The LargeTIFFTools achieve similar functionality for huge TIFF images which do not fit into RAM. We test the performance of these tools on several digital slides and compare them, when applicable, to standard software. A statistical study of the cells in a tissue sample from an oligodendroglioma was performed on an average laptop computer to demonstrate the efficiency of the tools.
CONCLUSIONS: Our open source software enables dealing with huge images with standard software on average computers. They are cross-platform, independent of proprietary libraries and very modular, allowing them to be used in other open source projects. They have excellent performance in terms of execution speed and RAM requirements. They open promising perspectives both to the clinician who wants to study a single slide and to the research team or data centre who do image analysis of many slides on a computer cluster.

Update (9/14/2015, Version 2, filenames annotated with "\_v2" suffix): For all objectives files and the objective catalog, the immersion oil layer semi-diameter has been changed to float so as to prevent unrealistic vignetting that may otherwise occur. Additionally, for all multiconfiguration files, the "before image plane" configuration has been modified. Specifically, the position of the Bertrand Lens has been modified so that it correctly images the BFP image onto the real image plane. In all cases, this required a shift in the position of the Bertrand Lens of {\textasciitilde}1cm further from the tube lens.

	doi = {10.1007/s11548-011-0617-x},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The time-of-flight (ToF) technique is an emerging technique for rapidly acquiring distance information and is becoming increasingly popular for intra-operative surface acquisition. Using the ToF technique as an intra-operative imaging modality requires seamless integration into the clinical workflow. We thus aim to integrate ToF support in an existing framework for medical image processing.
METHODS: MITK-ToF was implemented as an extension of the open-source C++ Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK) and provides the basic functionality needed for rapid prototyping and development of image-guided therapy (IGT) applications that utilize range data for intra-operative surface acquisition. This framework was designed with a module-based architecture separating the hardware-dependent image acquisition task from the processing of the range data.
RESULTS: The first version of MITK-ToF has been released as an open-source toolkit and supports several ToF cameras and basic processing algorithms. The toolkit, a sample application, and a tutorial are available from http://mitk.org.
CONCLUSIONS: With the increased popularity of time-of-flight cameras for intra-operative surface acquisition, integration of range data supports into medical image processing toolkits such as MITK is a necessary step. Handling acquisition of range data from different cameras and processing of the data requires the establishment and use of software design principles that emphasize flexibility, extendibility, robustness, performance, and portability. The open-source toolkit MITK-ToF satisfies these requirements for the image-guided therapy community and was already used in several research projects.},

	abstract = {We constructed a simple and compact imaging system designed specifically for the recording of fast neuronal activity in a 3D volume. The system uses an Yb:KYW femtosecond laser we designed for use with acousto-optic deflection. An integrated two-axis acousto-optic deflector, driven by digitally synthesized signals, can target locations in three dimensions. Data acquisition and the control of scanning are performed by a LeCroy digital oscilloscope. The total cost of construction was one order of magnitude lower than that of a typical Ti:sapphire system. The entire imaging apparatus, including the laser, fits comfortably onto a small rig for electrophysiology. Despite the low cost and simplicity, the convergence of several new technologies allowed us to achieve the following capabilities: i) full-frame acquisition at video rates suitable for patch clamping; ii) random access in under ten microseconds with dwelling ability in the nominal focal plane; iii) three-dimensional random access with the ability to perform fast volume sweeps at kilohertz rates; and iv) fluorescence lifetime imaging. We demonstrate the ability to record action potentials with high temporal resolution using intracellularly loaded potentiometric dye di-2-ANEPEQ. Our design proffers easy integration with electrophysiology and promises a more widespread adoption of functional two-photon imaging as a tool for the study of neuronal activity.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-12-126},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, the availability of high-resolution microscopy together with the advancements in the development of biomarkers as reporters of biomolecular interactions increased the importance of imaging methods in molecular cell biology. These techniques enable the investigation of cellular characteristics like volume, size and geometry as well as volume and geometry of intracellular compartments, and the amount of existing proteins in a spatially resolved manner. Such detailed investigations opened up many new areas of research in the study of spatial, complex and dynamic cellular systems. One of the crucial challenges for the study of such systems is the design of a well stuctured and optimized workflow to provide a systematic and efficient hypothesis verification. Computer Science can efficiently address this task by providing software that facilitates handling, analysis, and evaluation of biological data to the benefit of experimenters and modelers.
RESULTS: The Spatio-Temporal Simulation Environment (STSE) is a set of open-source tools provided to conduct spatio-temporal simulations in discrete structures based on microscopy images. The framework contains modules to digitize, represent, analyze, and mathematically model spatial distributions of biochemical species. Graphical user interface (GUI) tools provided with the software enable meshing of the simulation space based on the Voronoi concept. In addition, it supports to automatically acquire spatial information to the mesh from the images based on pixel luminosity (e.g. corresponding to molecular levels from microscopy images). STSE is freely available either as a stand-alone version or included in the linux live distribution Systems Biology Operational Software (SB.OS) and can be downloaded from http://www.stse-software.org/. The Python source code as well as a comprehensive user manual and video tutorials are also offered to the research community. We discuss main concepts of the STSE design and workflow. We demonstrate it's usefulness using the example of a signaling cascade leading to formation of a morphological gradient of Fus3 within the cytoplasm of the mating yeast cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
CONCLUSIONS: STSE is an efficient and powerful novel platform, designed for computational handling and evaluation of microscopic images. It allows for an uninterrupted workflow including digitization, representation, analysis, and mathematical modeling. By providing the means to relate the simulation to the image data it allows for systematic, image driven model validation or rejection. STSE can be scripted and extended using the Python language. STSE should be considered rather as an API together with workflow guidelines and a collection of GUI tools than a stand alone application. The priority of the project is to provide an easy and intuitive way of extending and customizing software using the Python language.},

However, achieving quantitative Fourier space measurements requires a thorough understanding of the impact of aberrations introduced by optical microscopes that have been optimized for conventional real-space imaging. Here we present a detailed framework for analyzing the performance of microscope objectives for several common Fourier imaging configurations. To this end, we model objectives from Nikon, Olympus, and Zeiss using parameters that were inferred from patent literature and confirmed, where possible, by physical disassembly. We then examine the aberrations most relevant to Fourier microscopy, including the alignment tolerances of apodization factors for different objective classes, the effect of magnification on the modulation transfer function, and vignetting-induced reductions of the effective numerical aperture for wide-field measurements. Based on this analysis, we identify an optimal objective class and imaging configuration for Fourier microscopy. In addition, the Zemax files for the objectives and setups used in this analysis have been made publicly available as a resource for future studies.},

Automated tracking of animal movement is less labor-intensive and bias-prone than direct observation, and allows for simultaneous analysis of multiple animals, high spatial and temporal resolution, and data collection over extended periods of time. Here, we present a new video-tracking system built on Python-based software that is free, open source, and cross-platform, and that can analyze video input from widely available video capture devices such as smartphone cameras and webcams. We validated this software through four tests on a variety of animal species, including larval and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), Siberian dwarf hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), and wild birds. These tests highlight the capacity of our software for long-term data acquisition, parallel analysis of multiple animals, and application to animal species of different sizes and movement patterns. We applied the software to an analysis of the effects of ethanol on thigmotaxis (wall-hugging) behavior on adult zebrafish, and found that acute ethanol treatment decreased thigmotaxis behaviors without affecting overall amounts of motion. The open source nature of our software enables flexibility, customization, and scalability in behavioral analyses. Moreover, our system presents a free alternative to commercial video-tracking systems and is thus broadly applicable to a wide variety of educational settings and research programs.},

An ecosystem of free open-source software exists to fill these gaps, including thousands of analysis and plotting packages written in Python and R, which can be implemented in a sharable and reproducible format, such as the Jupyter electronic notebook. This tool chain can largely replace current routines by importing data, producing analyses, and generating publication-quality graphics. An electronic notebook like Jupyter allows these analyses, along with documentation of procedures, to display locally or remotely in an internet browser, which can be saved as an HTML, PDF, or other file format for sharing with team members and the scientific community. The present report illustrates these methods using data from electrophysiological recordings of the musk shrew vagus-a model system to investigate gut-brain communication, for example, in cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis. We show methods for spike sorting (including statistical validation), spike train analysis, and analysis of compound action potentials in notebooks. Raw data and code are available from notebooks in data supplements or from an executable online version, which replicates all analyses without installing software-an implementation of reproducible research. This demonstrates the promise of combining disparate analyses into one platform, along with the ease of sharing this work.

While DV3D is primarily a visualization tool, the package allows an analysis approach where results from one imaging modality can guide comparative analysis of another modality in a single coordinate space. DV3D is built on Python, a dynamic object-oriented programming language with support for integration of modular toolkits, and development of cross-platform software for neuroimaging. DV3D harnesses the power of the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for two-dimensional (2D) and 3D rendering, calling VTK's low level C++ functions from Python. Users interact with data via an intuitive interface that uses Python to bind wxWidgets, which in turn calls the user's operating system dialogs and graphical user interface tools. DV3D currently supports NIfTI-1, ANALYZE and DICOM formats for MRI data display (including statistical data overlay). Formats for other data types are supported. The modularity of DV3D and ease of use of Python allows rapid integration of additional format support and user development. DV3D has been tested on Mac OSX, RedHat Linux and Microsoft Windows XP.

In the mouse, area-to-area connections have only been systematically mapped using bulk labeling techniques, which obscure the diverse projections of intermingled single neurons. Here we describe MAPseq (Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing), a technique that can map the projections of thousands or even millions of single neurons by labeling large sets of neurons with random RNA sequences (“barcodes”). Axons are filled with barcode mRNA, each putative projection area is dissected, and the barcode mRNA is extracted and sequenced. Applying MAPseq to the locus coeruleus (LC), we find that individual LC neurons have preferred cortical targets. By recasting neuroanatomy, which is traditionally viewed as a problem of microscopy, as a problem of sequencing, MAPseq harnesses advances in sequencing technology to permit high-throughput interrogation of brain circuits.},

The necessity to analyze large volumetric data sets accurately, efficiently, and in true 3D has been a major bottleneck in deriving reliable relationships between altered neuronal function and changes in spine morphology. We introduce a novel system for automated detection, shape analysis and classification of dendritic spines from laser scanning microscopy (LSM) images that directly addresses these limitations. The system is more accurate, and at least an order of magnitude faster, than existing technologies. By operating fully in 3D the algorithm resolves spines that are undetectable with standard two-dimensional (2D) tools. Adaptive local thresholding, voxel clustering and Rayburst Sampling generate a profile of diameter estimates used to classify spines into morphologic types, while minimizing optical smear and quantization artifacts. The technique opens new horizons on the objective evaluation of spine changes with synaptic plasticity, normal development and aging, and with neurodegenerative disorders that impair cognitive function.},

Mathematical models are used to predict the distribution of out-of-focus light caused by the inherent optical limitations of the instrument, which can then be compensated for using computer algorithms. This unit will review the theory of image formation and characteristics of the point spread function (PSF) based on the instrument modality and objective lens parameters. A variety of commonly used deblurring and deconvolution methods are described, and their applications to sample datasets are illustrated to show the performance of each algorithm. Steps for setting up the image acquisition to acquire data suitable for deconvolution are described, and the challenge of maximizing signal levels while minimizing light exposure addressed.

	doi = {10.2196/ijmr.2480},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to prescribed medications is a serious health problem in the United States, costing an estimated \$100 billion per year. While poor adherence should be addressable with point of care health information technology, integrating new solutions with existing electronic health records (EHR) systems require customization within each organization, which is difficult because of the monolithic software design of most EHR products.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to create a published algorithm for predicting medication adherence problems easily accessible at the point of care through a Web application that runs on the Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusuable Technologies (SMART) platform. The SMART platform is an emerging framework that enables EHR systems to behave as "iPhone like platforms" by exhibiting an application programming interface for easy addition and deletion of third party apps. The app is presented as a point of care solution to monitoring medication adherence as well as a sufficiently general, modular application that may serve as an example and template for other SMART apps.
METHODS: The widely used, open source Django framework was used together with the SMART platform to create the interoperable components of this app. Django uses Python as its core programming language. This allows statistical and mathematical modules to be created from a large array of Python numerical libraries and assembled together with the core app to create flexible and sophisticated EHR functionality. Algorithms that predict individual adherence are derived from a retrospective study of dispensed medication claims from a large private insurance plan. Patients' prescription fill information is accessed through the SMART framework and the embedded algorithms compute adherence information, including predicted adherence one year after the first prescription fill. Open source graphing software is used to display patient medication information and the results of statistical prediction of future adherence on a clinician-facing Web interface.
RESULTS: The user interface allows the physician to quickly review all medications in a patient record for potential non-adherence problems. A gap-check and current medication possession ratio (MPR) threshold test are applied to all medications in the record to test for current non-adherence. Predictions of 1-year non-adherence are made for certain drug classes for which external data was available. Information is presented graphically to indicate present non-adherence, or predicted non-adherence at one year, based on early prescription fulfillment patterns. The MPR Monitor app is installed in the SMART reference container as the "MPR Monitor", where it is publically available for use and testing. MPR is an acronym for Medication Possession Ratio, a commonly used measure of adherence to a prescribed medication regime. This app may be used as an example for creating additional functionality by replacing statistical and display algorithms with new code in a cycle of rapid prototyping and implementation or as a framework for a new SMART app.
CONCLUSIONS: The MPR Monitor app is a useful pilot project for monitoring medication adherence. It also provides an example that integrates several open source software components, including the Python-based Django Web framework and python-based graphics, to build a SMART app that allows complex decision support methods to be encapsulated to enhance EHR functionality.},

	doi = {10.1186/1751-0473-4-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Video cameras sense passively from a distance, offer a rich information stream, and provide intuitively meaningful raw data. Camera-based imaging has thus proven critical for many advances in neuroscience and biology, with applications ranging from cellular imaging of fluorescent dyes to tracking of whole-animal behavior at ecologically relevant spatial scales.
RESULTS: Here we present 'Motmot': an open-source software suite for acquiring, displaying, saving, and analyzing digital video in real-time. At the highest level, Motmot is written in the Python computer language. The large amounts of data produced by digital cameras are handled by low-level, optimized functions, usually written in C. This high-level/low-level partitioning and use of select external libraries allow Motmot, with only modest complexity, to perform well as a core technology for many high-performance imaging tasks. In its current form, Motmot allows for: (1) image acquisition from a variety of camera interfaces (package motmot.cam\_iface), (2) the display of these images with minimal latency and computer resources using wxPython and OpenGL (package motmot.wxglvideo), (3) saving images with no compression in a single-pass, low-CPU-use format (package motmot.FlyMovieFormat), (4) a pluggable framework for custom analysis of images in realtime and (5) firmware for an inexpensive USB device to synchronize image acquisition across multiple cameras, with analog input, or with other hardware devices (package motmot.fview\_ext\_trig). These capabilities are brought together in a graphical user interface, called 'FView', allowing an end user to easily view and save digital video without writing any code. One plugin for FView, 'FlyTrax', which tracks the movement of fruit flies in real-time, is included with Motmot, and is described to illustrate the capabilities of FView.
CONCLUSION: Motmot enables realtime image processing and display using the Python computer language. In addition to the provided complete applications, the architecture allows the user to write relatively simple plugins, which can accomplish a variety of computer vision tasks and be integrated within larger software systems. The software is available at http://code.astraw.com/projects/motmot.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are a promising means for restoring communication to patients suffering from “locked-in” syndrome. Research to improve system performance primarily focuses on means to overcome the low signal to noise ratio of electroencephalogric (EEG) recordings. However, the literature and methods are difficult to compare due to the array of evaluation metrics and assumptions underlying them, including that: 1) all characters are equally probable, 2) character selection is memoryless, and 3) errors occur completely at random. The standardization of evaluation metrics that more accurately reflect the amount of information contained in BCI language output is critical to make progress. We present a mutual information-based metric that incorporates prior information and a model of systematic errors. The parameters of a system used in one study were re-optimized, showing that the metric used in optimization significantly affects the parameter values chosen and the resulting system performance. The results of 11 BCI communication studies were then evaluated using different metrics, including those previously used in BCI literature and the newly advocated metric. Six studies' results varied based on the metric used for evaluation and the proposed metric produced results that differed from those originally published in two of the studies. Standardizing metrics to accurately reflect the rate of information transmission is critical to properly evaluate and compare BCI communication systems and advance the field in an unbiased manner.},

Various studies using neuroimaging and neurophysiologic techniques have suggested that in many neuropsychiatric disorders, these dynamic brain networks are dysregulated. Here we review the utility of combined noninvasive brain stimulation and neuroimaging approaches towards greater understanding of dynamic brain networks in health and disease. Brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, use electromagnetic principles to noninvasively alter brain activity, and induce focal but also network effects beyond the stimulation site. When combined with brain imaging techniques such as functional MRI, PET and EEG, these brain stimulation techniques enable a causal assessment of the interaction between different network components, and their respective functional roles. The same techniques can also be applied to explore hypotheses regarding the changes in functional connectivity that occur during task performance and in various disease states such as stroke, depression and schizophrenia. Finally, in diseases characterized by pathologic alterations in either the excitability within a single region or in the activity of distributed networks, such techniques provide a potential mechanism to alter cortical network function and architectures in a beneficial manner.},

More specifically, we consider the diversity in space (nodes or brain regions) over time using the concept of intrinsic ignition, which are naturally occurring intrinsic perturbations reflecting the capability of a given brain area to propagate neuronal activity to other regions in a given brain state. Characterizing the profile of intrinsic ignition for a given brain state provides insight into the precise nature of hierarchical information processing.

This is not an easy task as most subcellular recording techniques require absolute head stability. The Go/No-Go sensory task is a powerful decision-driven task that enables an animal to report a binary decision during head-fixation. Here we discuss how to set up an Arduino and Python based platform system to control a Go/No-Go sensory behavior paradigm. Using an Arduino micro-controller and python-based custom written program, a reward can be delivered to the animal depending on the decision reported. We discuss the various components required to build the behavioral apparatus that can control and report such a sensory stimulus paradigm. This system enables the end user to control the behavioral testing in real-time and therefore it provides a strong custom-made platform for probing the neural basis of behavior.},

However, stable recordings from small, densely packed neurons remains challenging, particularly over time-scales relevant for learning. Approach . We describe an assembly method for a 16-channel electrode array consisting of carbon fibers ({\textless}5 µm diameter) individually insulated with Parylene-C and fire-sharpened. The diameter of the array is approximately 26 µm along the full extent of the implant. Main results . Carbon fiber arrays were tested in HVC (used as a proper name), a song motor nucleus, of singing zebra finches where individual neurons discharge with temporally precise patterns. Previous reports of activity in this population of neurons have required the use of high impedance electrodes on movable microdrives. Here, the carbon fiber electrodes provided stable multi-unit recordings over time-scales of months. Spike-sorting indicated that the multi-unit signals were dominated by one, or a small number of cells. Stable firing patterns during singing confirmed the stability of these clusters over time-scales of months. In addition, from a total of 10 surgeries, 16 projection neurons were found. This cell type is characterized by sparse stereotyped firing patterns, providing unambiguous confirmation of single cell recordings. Significance. Carbon fiber electrode bundles may provide a scalable solution for long-term neural recordings of densely packed neurons.},

	abstract = {Mechanistic understanding of how the brain gives rise to complex behavioral and cognitive functions is one of science’s grand challenges. The technical challenges that we face as we attempt to gain a systems-level understanding of the brain are manifold. The brain’s structural complexity requires us to push the limit of imaging resolution and depth, while being able to cover large areas, resulting in enormous data acquisition and processing needs. Furthermore, it is necessary to detect functional activities and ‘map’ them onto the structural features. The functional activity occurs at multiple levels, using electrical and chemical signals. Certain electrical signals are only decipherable with sub-millisecond timescale resolution, while other modes of signals occur in minutes to hours. For these reasons, there is a wide consensus that new tools are necessary to undertake this daunting task. Optical techniques, due to their versatile and scalable nature, have great potentials to answer these challenges. Optical microscopy can now image beyond the diffraction limit, record multiple types of brain activity, and trace structural features across large areas of tissue. Genetically encoded molecular tools opened doors to controlling and detecting neural activity using light in specific cell types within the intact brain. Novel sample preparation methods that reduce light scattering have been developed, allowing whole brain imaging in rodent models. Adaptive optical methods have the potential to resolve images from deep brain regions. In this roadmap article, we showcase a few major advances in this area, survey the current challenges, and identify potential future needs that may be used as a guideline for the next steps to be taken.},

	abstract = {The measurement of activity in vivo and in vitro has shifted from electrical to optical methods. While the indicators for imaging activity have improved significantly over the last decade, tools for analysing optical data have not kept pace. Most available analysis tools are limited in their flexibility and applicability to datasets obtained at different spatial scales. Here, we present SamuROI (Structured analysis of multiple user-defined ROIs), an open source Python-based analysis environment for imaging data. SamuROI simplifies exploratory analysis and visualization of image series of fluorescence changes in complex structures over time and is readily applicable at different spatial scales. In this paper, we show the utility of SamuROI in Ca(2+)-imaging based applications at three spatial scales: the micro-scale (i.e., sub-cellular compartments including cell bodies, dendrites and spines); the meso-scale, (i.e., whole cell and population imaging with single-cell resolution); and the macro-scale (i.e., imaging of changes in bulk fluorescence in large brain areas, without cellular resolution). The software described here provides a graphical user interface for intuitive data exploration and region of interest (ROI) management that can be used interactively within Jupyter Notebook: a publicly available interactive Python platform that allows simple integration of our software with existing tools for automated ROI generation and post-processing, as well as custom analysis pipelines. SamuROI software, source code and installation instructions are publicly available on GitHub and documentation is available online. SamuROI reduces the energy barrier for manual exploration and semi-automated analysis of spatially complex Ca(2+) imaging datasets, particularly when these have been acquired at different spatial scales.},

We propose the use of a compressed sensing (CS) framework to efficiently compress these signals at the sensor node. Our framework exploits both the temporal correlation within EEG signals and the spatial correlations amongst the EEG channels. We show that our framework is up to eight times more energy efficient than the typical wavelet compression method in terms of compression and encoding computations and wireless transmission. We also show that for a fixed compression ratio, our method achieves a better reconstruction quality than the CS-based state-of-the art method. We finally demonstrate that our method is robust to measurement noise and to packet loss and that it is applicable to a wide range of EEG signal types.},

This two-way communication allows us to monitor the state of the brain and its composite networks and cells as well as to influence them to treat disease or repair/restore sensory or motor function. To provide the most stable and effective interface, the tools of the trade must bridge the soft, ion-rich, and evolving nature of neural tissue with the largely rigid, static realm of microelectronics and medical instruments that allow for readout, analysis, and/or control. In this Review, we describe how the understanding of neural signaling and material-tissue interactions has fueled the expansion of the available tool set. New probe architectures and materials, nanoparticles, dyes, and designer genetically encoded proteins push the limits of recording and stimulation lifetime, localization, and specificity, blurring the boundary between living tissue and engineered tools. Understanding these approaches, their modality, and the role of cross-disciplinary development will support new neurotherapies and prostheses and provide neuroscientists and neurologists with unprecedented access to the brain.

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.061},
	abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z {\textless} 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of "clusters" of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as "threshold-free cluster enhancement" (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

However, formal information theoretic definitions until very recently were only available for information transfer and storage, not for modification. This has changed with the extension of Shannon information theory via the decomposition of the mutual information between inputs to and the output of a process into unique, shared and synergistic contributions from the inputs, called a partial information decomposition (PID). The synergistic contribution in particular has been identified as the basis for a definition of information modification. We here review the requirements for a functional definition of information modification in neuroscience, and apply a recently proposed measure of information modification to investigate the developmental trajectory of information modification in a culture of neurons vitro, using partial information decomposition. We found that modification rose with maturation, but ultimately collapsed when redundant information among neurons took over. This indicates that this particular developing neural system initially developed intricate processing capabilities, but ultimately displayed information processing that was highly similar across neurons, possibly due to a lack of external inputs. We close by pointing out the enormous promise PID and the analysis of information modification hold for the understanding of neural systems.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the heart of deep learning applications. Recent works PRIME [1] and ISAAC [2] demonstrated the promise of using resistive random access memory (ReRAM) to perform neural computations in memory. We found that training cannot be efficiently supported with the current schemes. First, they do not consider weight update and complex data dependency in training procedure. Second, ISAAC attempts to increase system throughput with a very deep pipeline. It is only beneficial when a large number of consecutive images can be fed into the architecture. In training, the notion of batch (e.g. 64) limits the number of images can be processed consecutively, because the images in the next batch need to be processed based on the updated weights. Third, the deep pipeline in ISAAC is vulnerable to pipeline bubbles and execution stall. In this paper, we present PipeLayer, a ReRAM-based PIM accelerator for CNNs that support both training and testing. We analyze data dependency and weight update in training algorithms and propose efficient pipeline to exploit inter-layer parallelism. To exploit intra-layer parallelism, we propose highly parallel design based on the notion of parallelism granularity and weight replication. With these design choices, PipeLayer enables the highly pipelined execution of both training and testing, without introducing the potential stalls in previous work. The experiment results show that, PipeLayer achieves the speedup of 42.45x compared with GPU platform on average. The average energy saving of PipeLayer compared with GPU implementation is 7.17x.},

	abstract = {Complex systems are increasingly being viewed as distributed information processing systems, particularly in the domains of computational neuroscience, bioinformatics and Artificial Life. This trend has resulted in a strong uptake in the use of (Shannon) information-theoretic measures to analyse the dynamics of complex systems in these fields. We introduce the Java Information Dynamics Toolkit (JIDT): a Google code project which provides a standalone, (GNU GPL v3 licensed) open-source code implementation for empirical estimation of information-theoretic measures from time-series data. While the toolkit provides classic information-theoretic measures (e.g. entropy, mutual information, conditional mutual information), it ultimately focusses on implementing higher-level measures for information dynamics. That is, JIDT focusses on quantifying information storage, transfer and modification, and the dynamics of these operations in space and time. For this purpose, it includes implementations of the transfer entropy and active information storage, their multivariate extensions and local or pointwise variants. JIDT provides implementations for both discrete and continuous-valued data for each measure, including various types of estimator for continuous data (e.g. Gaussian, box-kernel and Kraskov-Stoegbauer-Grassberger) which can be swapped at run-time due to Java's object-oriented polymorphism. Furthermore, while written in Java, the toolkit can be used directly in MATLAB, GNU Octave, Python and other environments. We present the principles behind the code design, and provide several examples to guide users.},

This article shows how to analyze neural systems using information theory with the aim of obtaining constraints that help to identify the algorithms run by neural systems and the information they represent. Algorithms and representations identified this way may then guide the design of biologically inspired computing systems. The material covered includes the necessary introduction to information theory and to the estimation of information theoretic quantities from neural recordings. We then show how to analyze the information encoded in a system about its environment, and also discuss recent methodological developments on the question of how much information each agent carries about the environment either uniquely, or redundantly or synergistically together with others. Last, we introduce the framework of local information dynamics, where information processing is partitioned into component processes of information storage, transfer, and modification -- locally in space and time. We close by discussing example applications of these measures to neural data and other complex systems.},

Navigation problems on uneven terrains and detection of the moving objects while the robot is itself in motion are the core problems that omnidirectional systems tackle. The proposed omnidirectional system is a compact and a rigid vision system with dioptric cameras that provide a 360 degrees field-of-view in horizontal and vertical, with no blind spot in their site combined with a high-resolution stereo camera to monitor anterior field-of-view for a more accurate perception with depth information of the scene.

However, the relatively limited computational power of embedded platforms is considered as a bottleneck for many vision applications, necessitating optimization. OpenVX is a standardized interface, released in late 2014, in an attempt to provide both system and kernel level optimization to vision applications. With OpenVX, Vision processing are modeled with coarse-grained data flow graphs, which can be optimized and accelerated by the platform implementer. Current full implementations of OpenVX are given in the programming language C, which does not support advanced programming paradigms such as object-oriented, imperative and functional programming, nor does it have runtime or type-checking. Here we present a python-based full Implementation of OpenVX, which eliminates much of the discrepancies between the object-oriented paradigm used by many modern applications and the native C implementations. Our open-source implementation can be used for rapid development of OpenVX applications in embedded platforms. Demonstration includes static and real-time image acquisition and processing using a Raspberry Pi and a GoPro camera. Code is given as supplementary information.

In this study, we investigated the effect of FUS on PAC between neuronal oscillations and established the relationship between the PAC index and ultrasonic intensity. The rat hippocampus was stimulated using focused ultrasound at different spatial-average pulse-average ultrasonic intensities (3.9 W/cm2, 9.6 W/cm2, and 19.2 W/cm2). The local field potentials (LFPs) in the rat hippocampus were recorded before and after FUS. Then, we analyzed PAC between neuronal oscillations using a PAC calculation algorithm. Our results showed that FUS significantly modulated PAC between the theta (4-8 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) bands and between the alpha (9-13 Hz) and ripple (81-200 Hz) bands in the rat hippocampus, and PAC increased with incremental increases in ultrasonic intensity.},

	abstract = {We propose an original method for detecting and localizing anomalous motion patterns in videos from a camera view -based motion representation perspective. Anomalous motion should be taken in a broad sense, i.e., unexpected, abnormal, singular, irregular, or unusual motion. Identifying distinctive dynamic information at any time point and at any image location in a sequence of images is a key requirement in many situations and applications. The proposed method relies on so-called labeled affine flows (LAF) involving both affine velocity vectors and affine motion classes. At every pixel a motion class is inferred from the affine motion model selected in a set of candidate models estimated over a collection of windows. Then, the image is subdivided in blocks where motion class histograms weighted by the affine motion vector magnitudes are computed. They are compared blockwise to histograms of normal behaviours with a dedicated distance. More specifically, we introduce the local outlier factor (LOF) to detect anomalous blocks. LOF is a local flexible measure of the relative density of data points in a feature space, here the space of LAF histograms. By thresholding the LOF value, we can detect an anomalous motion pattern in any block at any time instant of the video sequence. The threshold value is automatically set in each block by means of statistical arguments. We report comparative experiments on several real video datasets, demonstrating that our method is highly competitive for the intricate task of detecting different types of anomalous motion in videos. Specifically, we obtain very competitive results on all the tested datasets: 99.2 {\textbackslash}\% AUC for UMN, 82.8 {\textbackslash}\% AUC for UCSD, and 95.73 {\textbackslash}\% accuracy for PETS 2009, at the frame level.},

	abstract = {Task-related hemodynamic responses contribute prominently to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. They reflect behaviorally important brain states, such as arousal and attention, and can dominate stimulus-evoked responses, yet they remain poorly understood. To help characterize these responses, we present a method for parametrically estimating both stimulus-evoked and task-related components of hemodynamic responses from subjects engaged in temporally predictable tasks. The stimulus-evoked component is modeled by convolving a hemodynamic response function (HRF) kernel with spiking. The task-related component is modeled by convolving a Fourier-series task-related function (TRF) kernel with task timing. We fit this model with simultaneous electrode recordings and intrinsic-signal optical imaging from the primary visual cortex of alert, task-engaged monkeys. With high {\textless}strong{\textgreater}\textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/strong{\textgreater}, the model returns HRFs that are consistent across experiments and recording sites for a given animal and TRFs that entrain to task timing independent of stimulation or local spiking. When the task schedule conflicts with that of stimulation, the TRF remains locked to the task emphasizing its behavioral origins. The current approach is strikingly more robust to fluctuations than earlier ones and gives consistently, if modestly, better fits. This approach could help parse the distinct components of fMRI recordings made in the context of a task.},

Tasks as varied as the diagnosis of disease from magnetic resonance images, brain–computer interfaces for the disabled, and the decoding of brain functioning based on electrical activity have been accomplished quite successfully with pattern classification. These classifiers have been further applied in complex cognitive tasks to improve performance, in one example as an input to adaptive automation. In order to produce generalizable results and facilitate the development of practical systems, these techniques should be stable across repeated sessions. This paper describes the application of three popular pattern classification techniques to EEG data obtained from asymptotically trained subjects performing a complex multitask across five days in one month. All three classifiers performed well above chance levels. The performance of all three was significantly negatively impacted by classifying across days; however two modifications are presented that substantially reduce misclassifications. The results demonstrate that with proper methods, pattern classification is stable enough across days and weeks to be a valid, useful approach.},

	abstract = {Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) provides quantifiable information on the non-Gaussian behavior of water diffusion in biological tissue. Changes in water diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters and DKI parameters in several white and gray matter regions were investigated in a mild controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury rat model at both the acute (2h) and the sub-acute (7days) stages following injury. Mixed model ANOVA analysis revealed significant changes in temporal patterns of both DTI and DKI parameters in the cortex, hippocampus, external capsule and corpus callosum. Post-hoc tests indicated acute changes in mean diffusivity (MD) in the bilateral cortex and hippocampus (p{\textless}0.0005) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in ipsilateral cortex (p{\textless}0.0005), hippocampus (p=0.014), corpus callosum (p=0.031) and contralateral external capsule (p=0.011). These changes returned to baseline by the sub-acute stage. However, mean kurtosis (MK) was significantly elevated at the sub-acute stages in all ipsilateral regions and scaled inversely with the distance from the impacted site (cortex and corpus callosum: p{\textless}0.0005; external capsule: p=0.003; hippocampus: p=0.011). Further, at the sub-acute stage increased MK was also observed in the contralateral regions compared to baseline (cortex: p=0.032; hippocampus: p=0.039) while no change was observed with MD and FA. An increase in mean kurtosis was associated with increased reactive astrogliosis from immunohistochemistry analysis. Our results suggest that DKI is sensitive to microstructural changes associated with reactive astrogliosis which may be missed by standard DTI parameters alone. Monitoring changes in MK allows the investigation of molecular and morphological changes in vivo due to reactive astrogliosis and may complement information available from standard DTI parameters. To date the use of diffusion tensor imaging has been limited to study changes in white matter integrity following traumatic insults. Given the sensitivity of DKI to detect microstructural changes even in the gray matter in vivo, allows the extension of the technique to understand patho-morphological changes in the whole brain following a traumatic insult.},

	abstract = {Information theoretic measures can be used to identify nonlinear interactions between source and target variables through reductions in uncertainty. In information partitioning, multivariate mutual information is decomposed into synergistic, unique, and redundant components. Synergy is information shared only when sources influence a target together, uniqueness is information only provided by one source, and redundancy is overlapping shared information from multiple sources. While this partitioning has been applied to provide insights into complex dependencies, several proposed partitioning methods overestimate redundant information and omit a component of unique information because they do not account for source dependencies. Additionally, information partitioning has only been applied to time-series data in a limited context, using basic pdf estimation techniques or a Gaussian assumption. We develop a Rescaled Redundancy measure (Rs) to solve the source dependency issue, and present Gaussian, autoregressive, and chaotic test cases to demonstrate its advantages over existing techniques in the presence of noise, various source correlations, and different types of interactions. This study constitutes the first rigorous application of information partitioning to environmental time-series data, and addresses how noise, pdf estimation technique, or source dependencies can influence detected measures. We illustrate how our techniques can unravel the complex nature of forcing and feedback within an ecohydrologic system with an application to 1 min environmental signals of air temperature, relative humidity, and windspeed. The methods presented here are applicable to the study of a broad range of complex systems composed of interacting variables.},

This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, uni- and multi-dimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. Open-source Matlab and Python code implementing the new methods is available at: https://github.com/robince/gcmi We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We demonstrate the benefits of a multivariate statistical approach with examples such as MEG vector magnetic fields (including separate quantification of stimulus modulations of amplitude and direction) as well as considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG signals as a two-dimensional response. A particular advantage of the information theoretic framework is its ability to quantify representational interactions between different neuroimaging responses: for example, different cortical regions, frequency bands, time periods or recording modalities (i.e. simultaneous recorded EEG and fMRI). Such interactions are quantified as redundancy (overlapping information content) and synergy (joint information not available in the individual responses). Conceptually, this is similar to methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis or the cross-classification decoding technique, which quantify the similarity of stimulus representation in different neural responses (but cannot address synergistic effects). However, the information theoretic approach can be applied with a wider range of experimental designs, and to univariate responses, which allows mapping of representational interactions with the full spatial and temporal resolution of the recorded signals. By combining the Gaussian copula mutual information estimator and the information theoretic approach to quantifying representational interactions within the Wiener-Granger framework for causal inference, we have developed an approach to measuring functional connectivity that is grounded in specific stimulus information content. We have demonstrated within-subject cross-hemisphere communication of information about eye visibility in a face detection task (Ince et al., 2016b) using sensor space EEG data. We have also developed Directed Feature Information (DFI), a novel measure of directed functional connectivity which quantifies communication about the specific stimulus features subtending perceptual decisions (Ince et al., 2015). These developments allow for network level analyses of functional neuroimaging data that are directly grounded in the representation, processing and communication of specific stimulus features, and so provide the promise of a new perspective on the algorithmic basis of many cognitive functions.},

Many investigators implant electrode arrays in multiple brain areas and record from chronically implanted electrodes over time to answer a variety of questions. Technical challenges related to analyzing large-scale neuronal recording data are not trivial. Several analysis methods traditionally used by neurophysiologists do not account for dependencies in the data that are inherent in multi-electrode recordings. In addition, when neurophysiological data are not best modeled by the normal distribution and when the variables of interest may not be linearly related, extensions of the linear modeling techniques are recommended. A variety of methods exist to analyze correlated data, even when the data are not normally distributed and the relationships are nonlinear. Here we review expansions of the Generalized Linear Model designed to address these data properties. Such methods are used in other research fields, and the application to large-scale neuronal recording data will enable investigators to determine the variable properties that convincingly contribute to the variances in the observed neuronal measures. Standard measures of neuron properties such as response magnitudes can be analyzed using these methods, and measures of neuronal network activity such as spike timing correlations can be analyzed as well. We have done just that in recordings from 100-electrode arrays implanted in the primary somatosensory cortex of owl monkeys. Here we illustrate how one example method, Generalized Estimating Equations analysis, is a useful method to apply to large-scale neuronal recordings.},

In fact, many of the available open-source toolboxes still lack two fundamental requirements for treating multi-channel recordings: (i) a rich repertoire of algorithms for extracting information both at a single channel and at the whole network level; (ii) the capability of autonomously repeating the same set of computational operations to ‘multiple’ recording streams (also from different experiments) and without a manual intervention. The software package we are proposing, named SPYCODE, was mainly developed to respond to the above constraints and generally to offer the scientific community a ‘smart’ tool for multi-channel data processing.},

In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the genuine and random synchronization indexes in multivariate neural series, denoted as GSI (genuine synchronization index) and RSI (random synchronization index), by means of a correlation matrix analysis and surrogate technique. The performance of the method is evaluated by using a multi-channel neural mass model (MNMM), including the effects of different coupling coefficients, signal to noise ratios (SNRs) and time-window widths on the estimation of the GSI and RSI. Results show that the GSI and the RSI are superior in description of the synchronization in multivariate neural series compared to the S-estimator. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to analyze a 21-channel scalp electroencephalographic recording of a 35 year-old male who suffers from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The GSI and the RSI at different frequency bands during the epileptic seizure are estimated. The present results could be helpful for us to understand the synchronization mechanism of epileptic seizures.},

	abstract = {In many pattern classification/recognition applications of artificial neural networks, an object to be classified is represented by a fixed sized 2-dimensional array of uniform type, which corresponds to the cells of a 2-dimensional grid of the same size. A general neural network structure, called an undistricted neural network, which takes all the elements in the array as inputs could be used for problems such as these. However, a districted neural network can be used to reduce the training complexity. A districted neural network usually consists of two levels of sub-neural networks. Each of the lower level neural networks, called a regional sub-neural network, takes the elements in a region of the array as its inputs and is expected to output a temporary class label, called an individual opinion, based on the partial information of the entire array. The higher level neural network, called an assembling sub-neural network, uses the outputs (opinions) of regional sub-neural networks as inputs, and by consensus derives the label decision for the object. Each of the sub-neural networks can be trained separately and thus the training is less expensive. The regional sub-neural networks can be trained and performed in parallel and independently, therefore a high speed can be achieved. We prove theoretically in this paper, using a simple model, that a districted neural network is actually more stable than an undistricted neural network in noisy environments. We conjecture that the result is valid for all neural networks. This theory is verified by experiments involving gender classification and human face recognition. We conclude that a districted neural network is highly recommended for neural network applications in recognition or classification of 2-dimensional array patterns in highly noisy environments.},

Most of the successful models are based on deterministic mechanistic modeling. In order to describe the stochastic aspect of neuronal firing, I propose setting a deterministic model in a stochastic framework, namely, incorporating the multi-timescale adaptive threshold (MAT) model of neuronal spiking into the stochastic framework of the linear–nonlinear Poisson (LNP) model in the form of a generalized linear model (GLM). In this setting, the probability of spike occurrence is updated each time a spike is derived from the past probability. Accordingly, the model may account for nontrivial firing patterns of various neurons that cannot be realized with the inhomogeneous Poisson process. The stochastic MAT model is not only capable of characterizing firing mechanisms specific to individual neurons, but may render the statistical inference feasible for the underlying mechanisms from the data. I also examine here two plausible principles for adjusting the model parameters: maximizing the spike time coincidence between the model and data, and maximizing the likelihood. It is found that these principles bring about greatly different characteristics for an identical set of data.},

This paper introduces a Bayesian method for estimating PRCs from data, which allows for the correlation of errors in explanatory and response variables of the PRC. The method is implemented with a replica exchange Monte Carlo technique; this avoids local minima and enables efficient calculation of posterior averages. A test with artificial data generated by the noisy Morris–Lecar equation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional regression that ignores errors in the explanatory variable. Experimental data from the pyramidal cells in the rat motor cortex is also analyzed with the method; a case is found where the result with the proposed method is considerably different from that obtained by conventional regression.},

	abstract = {In order for patients with disabilities to control assistive devices with their own neural activity, multineuronal spike trains must be efficiently decoded because only limited computational resources can be used to generate prosthetic control signals in portable real-time applications. In this study, we compare the abilities of two vectorizing procedures (multineuronal and time-segmental) to extract information from spike trains during the same total neuron-seconds. In the multineuronal vectorizing procedure, we defined a response vector whose components represented the spike counts of one to five neurons. In the time-segmental vectorizing procedure, a response vector consisted of components representing a neuron’s spike counts for one to five time-segment(s) of a response period of 1 s. Spike trains were recorded from neurons in the inferior temporal cortex of monkeys presented with visual stimuli. We examined whether the amount of information of the visual stimuli carried by these neurons differed between the two vectorizing procedures. The amount of information calculated with the multineuronal vectorizing procedure, but not the time-segmental vectorizing procedure, significantly increased with the dimensions of the response vector. We conclude that the multineuronal vectorizing procedure is superior to the time-segmental vectorizing procedure in efficiently extracting information from neuronal signals.},

	abstract = {In order to understand how populations of neurons encode information about external correlates, it is important to develop minimal models of the probability of neural population responses which capture all the salient changes of neural responses with stimuli. In this context, it is particularly useful to determine whether interactions among neurons responding to stimuli can be described by a pairwise interaction model, or whether a higher order interaction model is needed. To address this question, we compared real neural population activity obtained from the rat somatosensory cortex to maximum-entropy models which take into account only interaction of up any given order. By performing these comparisons, we found that interactions of order two were sufficient to explain a large amount of observed stimulus-response distributions, but not all of them. Triple-wise interactions were necessary to fully explain the data. We then used Shannon information to compute the impact of high order correlations on the amount of somatosensory information transmitted by the neural population. We found that correlations of order two gave a good approximation of information carried by the neural population, within 4\% of the true value. Third order correlations gave an even better approximation, within 2\% of the true value. Taken together, these results suggest that higher order interactions exist and shape the dynamics of cortical networks, but play a quantitatively minor role in determining the information capacity of neural populations.},

Gunrock achieves a balance between performance and expressiveness by coupling high-performance GPU computing primitives and optimization strategies with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives with small code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge. We characterize the performance of various optimization strategies and evaluate Gunrock’s overall performance on different GPU architectures on a wide range of graph primitives that span from traversal-based algorithms and ranking algorithms, to triangle counting and bipartite-graph-based algorithms. The results show that on a single GPU, Gunrock has on average at least an order of magnitude speedup over Boost and PowerGraph, comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired primitives and CPU shared-memory graph libraries, such as Ligra and Galois, and better performance than any other GPU high-level graph library.},

Moreover, when the camera motion is jittery, most of the existing motion segmentation approaches fail. In this work, we propose an optimization framework for the segmentation of moving object in jittery videos. A novel Optical Trajectory Descriptor Matrix (OTDM) built on point trajectories has been proposed for this purpose. An optimization function has been formulated for stabilizing the trajectories, followed by spectral clustering of the proposed latent trajectories. Latent trajectories are obtained by performing Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) on the OTDM (factorization of OTDM using KL divergence). This integrated framework yields accurate clustering of the trajectories from jittery videos. Foreground pixel labelling is obtained by utilizing the clustered trajectory coordinates for modelling the foreground and background, using a GraphCut based energy formulation. Experiments were performed on 16 real-world jittery videos. Also, the results have been generated for a standard segmentation dataset, SegTrackv2, with synthetic jitter incorporated. Jitter extracted from a real video is inserted into stable SegTrackv2 videos for analysis of performance. The proposed method, when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, was found to be superior.},

The inherent closedloop responsiveness and decision making of IoT applications make them ideal candidates for using low latency and scalable stream processing platforms. Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) hosted on Cloud data-centers are becoming the vital engine for real-time data processing and analytics in any IoT software architecture. But the efficacy and performance of contemporary DSPS have not been rigorously studied for IoT applications and data streams. Here, we develop RIoTBench, a Realtime IoT Benchmark suite, along with performance metrics, to evaluate DSPS for streaming IoT applications. The benchmark includes 27 common IoT tasks classified across various functional categories and implemented as reusable micro-benchmarks. Further, we propose four IoT application benchmarks composed from these tasks, and that leverage various dataflow semantics of DSPS. The applications are based on common IoT patterns for data pre-processing, statistical summarization and predictive analytics. These are coupled with four stream workloads sourced from real IoT observations on smart cities and fitness, with peak streams rates that range from 500 to 10000 messages/sec and diverse frequency distributions. We validate the RIoTBench suite for the popular Apache Storm DSPS on the Microsoft Azure public Cloud, and present empirical observations. This suite can be used by DSPS researchers for performance analysis and resource scheduling, and by IoT practitioners to evaluate DSPS platforms.},

In Calipso, the user makes edits directly in 3D; these edits are processed by the simulation and then transfered to the target 2D content using shape-to-image correspondences in a photo-realistic rendering process. To align the CAD models, we introduce an efficient CAD-to-image alignment procedure that jointly minimizes for rigid and non-rigid alignment while preserving the high-level structure of the input shape. Moreover, the user can choose to exploit image flow to estimate scene motion, producing coherent physical behavior with ambient dynamics.

	abstract = {Standard video frame interpolation methods first estimate optical flow between input frames and then synthesize an intermediate frame guided by motion. Recent approaches merge these two steps into a single convolution process by convolving input frames with spatially adaptive kernels that account for motion and re-sampling simultaneously. These methods require large kernels to handle large motion, which limits the number of pixels whose kernels can be estimated at once due to the large memory demand. To address this problem, this paper formulates frame interpolation as local separable convolution over input frames using pairs of 1D kernels. Compared to regular 2D kernels, the 1D kernels require significantly fewer parameters to be estimated. Our method develops a deep fully convolutional neural network that takes two input frames and estimates pairs of 1D kernels for all pixels simultaneously. Since our method is able to estimate kernels and synthesizes the whole video frame at once, it allows for the incorporation of perceptual loss to train the neural network to produce visually pleasing frames. This deep neural network is trained end-to-end using widely available video data without any human annotation. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method provides a practical solution to high-quality video frame interpolation.},

	abstract = {Light field cameras have many advantages over traditional cameras, as they allow the user to change various camera settings after capture. However, capturing light fields requires a huge bandwidth to record the data: a modern light field camera can only take three images per second. This prevents current consumer light field cameras from capturing light field videos. Temporal interpolation at such extreme scale (10x, from 3 fps to 30 fps) is infeasible as too much information will be entirely missing between adjacent frames. Instead, we develop a hybrid imaging system, adding another standard video camera to capture the temporal information. Given a 3 fps light field sequence and a standard 30 fps 2D video, our system can then generate a full light field video at 30 fps. We adopt a learning-based approach, which can be decomposed into two steps: spatio-temporal flow estimation and appearance estimation. The flow estimation propagates the angular information from the light field sequence to the 2D video, so we can warp input images to the target view. The appearance estimation then combines these warped images to output the final pixels. The whole process is trained end-to-end using convolutional neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms current video interpolation methods, enabling consumer light field videography, and making applications such as refocusing and parallax view generation achievable on videos for the first time.},

	shorttitle = {Deep {Neuroevolution}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06567},
	abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of techniques that have been developed in the neuroevolution community to improve performance on RL problems. To demonstrate the latter, we show that combining DNNs with novelty search, which was designed to encourage exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g. DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA parallelizes better than ES, A3C, and DQN, and enables a state-of-the-art compact encoding technique that can represent million-parameter DNNs in thousands of bytes.},

High-speed, high resolution imaging can reveal dynamic events such as changes in blood flow and responses to stimulation. Despite these benefits, commercially available scientific cameras rarely include software that is suitable for in-vivo imaging applications, making this highly versatile form of optical imaging challenging and time-consuming to implement. To address this issue, we have developed a novel, open-source software package to control high-speed, multispectral optical imaging systems. The software integrates a number of modular functions through a custom graphical user interface (GUI) and provides extensive control over a wide range of inexpensive IEEE 1394 Firewire cameras. Multispectral illumination can be incorporated through the use of off-the-shelf light emitting diodes which the software synchronizes to image acquisition via a programmed microcontroller, allowing arbitrary high-speed illumination sequences. The complete software suite is available for free download. Here we describe the software’s framework and provide details to guide users with development of this and similar software.},

Here we describe our ‘Firefly’ microscope, which achieves these goals in a Ø6 mm FOV.

All but one of the optical elements are commercially available, yet the microscope achieves 10-fold higher light collection efficiency at its design magnification than the comparable commercially available microscope using the same objective. The Firefly microscope enables all-optical electrophysiology (‘Optopatch’) in cultured neurons with a throughput and information content unmatched by other neuronal phenotyping systems. This capability opens possibilities in disease modeling and phenotypic drug screening.

	abstract = {Background
A unique archive of Big Data on Parkinson’s Disease is collected, managed and disseminated by the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). The integration of such complex and heterogeneous Big Data from multiple sources offers unparalleled opportunities to study the early stages of prevalent neurodegenerative processes, track their progression and quickly identify the efficacies of alternative treatments. Many previous human and animal studies have examined the relationship of Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk to trauma, genetics, environment, co-morbidities, or life style. The defining characteristics of Big Data–large size, incongruency, incompleteness, complexity, multiplicity of scales, and heterogeneity of information-generating sources–all pose challenges to the classical techniques for data management, processing, visualization and interpretation. We propose, implement, test and validate complementary model-based and model-free approaches for PD classification and prediction. To explore PD risk using Big Data methodology, we jointly processed complex PPMI imaging, genetics, clinical and demographic data.

Methods and Findings
Collective representation of the multi-source data facilitates the aggregation and harmonization of complex data elements. This enables joint modeling of the complete data, leading to the development of Big Data analytics, predictive synthesis, and statistical validation. Using heterogeneous PPMI data, we developed a comprehensive protocol for end-to-end data characterization, manipulation, processing, cleaning, analysis and validation. Specifically, we (i) introduce methods for rebalancing imbalanced cohorts, (ii) utilize a wide spectrum of classification methods to generate consistent and powerful phenotypic predictions, and (iii) generate reproducible machine-learning based classification that enables the reporting of model parameters and diagnostic forecasting based on new data. We evaluated several complementary model-based predictive approaches, which failed to generate accurate and reliable diagnostic predictions. However, the results of several machine-learning based classification methods indicated significant power to predict Parkinson’s disease in the PPMI subjects (consistent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity exceeding 96\%, confirmed using statistical n-fold cross-validation). Clinical (e.g., Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores), demographic (e.g., age), genetics (e.g., rs34637584, chr12), and derived neuroimaging biomarker (e.g., cerebellum shape index) data all contributed to the predictive analytics and diagnostic forecasting.

Conclusions
Model-free Big Data machine learning-based classification methods (e.g., adaptive boosting, support vector machines) can outperform model-based techniques in terms of predictive precision and reliability (e.g., forecasting patient diagnosis). We observed that statistical rebalancing of cohort sizes yields better discrimination of group differences, specifically for predictive analytics based on heterogeneous and incomplete PPMI data. UPDRS scores play a critical role in predicting diagnosis, which is expected based on the clinical definition of Parkinson’s disease. Even without longitudinal UPDRS data, however, the accuracy of model-free machine learning based classification is over 80\%. The methods, software and protocols developed here are openly shared and can be employed to study other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as for other predictive Big Data analytics applications.},

How do we gain insight into the dynamic processes of disease and development from terabytes of multidimensional image data? Here I describe a collaborative approach to extracting meaning from biological imaging data. The collaboration consists of teams of biologists and engineers working together. Custom computational tools are built to best exploit application-specific knowledge in order to visualize and analyze large and complex data sets. The image data are summarized, extracting and modeling the features that capture the objects and relationships in the data. The summarization is validated, the results visualized, and errors corrected as needed. Finally, the customized analysis and visualization tools together with the image data and the summarization results are shared. This Perspective provides a brief guide to the mathematical ideas that rigorously quantify the notion of extracting meaning from biological image, and to the practical approaches that have been used to apply these ideas to a wide range of applications in cell and tissue optical imaging.},

	abstract = {We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method doesn't use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a universal similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The NCD is universal in that it is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal but uses the non-computable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose precise notions of similarity metric, normal compressor, and show that the NCD based on a normal compressor is a similarity metric that approximates universality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (binary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.},

Using this method, we asked whether rat retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) display characteristic phenotypes before undergoing mitosis that could foretell their fate. We predicted whether RPCs will undergo a self-renewing or terminal division with 99\% accuracy, or whether they will produce two photoreceptors or another combination of offspring with 87\% accuracy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neural stem cells are motile and proliferative cells that undergo mitosis, dividing to produce daughter cells and ultimately generating differentiated neurons and glia. Understanding the mechanisms controlling neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation will play a key role in the emerging fields of regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. Stem cell studies in vitro from 2-D image data are well established. Visualizing and analyzing large three dimensional images of intact tissue is a challenging task. It becomes more difficult as the dimensionality of the image data increases to include time and additional fluorescence channels. There is a pressing need for 5-D image analysis and visualization tools to study cellular dynamics in the intact niche and to quantify the role that environmental factors play in determining cell fate.
RESULTS: We present an application that integrates visualization and quantitative analysis of 5-D (x,y,z,t,channel) and large montage confocal fluorescence microscopy images. The image sequences show stem cells together with blood vessels, enabling quantification of the dynamic behaviors of stem cells in relation to their vascular niche, with applications in developmental and cancer biology. Our application automatically segments, tracks, and lineages the image sequence data and then allows the user to view and edit the results of automated algorithms in a stereoscopic 3-D window while simultaneously viewing the stem cell lineage tree in a 2-D window. Using the GPU to store and render the image sequence data enables a hybrid computational approach. An inference-based approach utilizing user-provided edits to automatically correct related mistakes executes interactively on the system CPU while the GPU handles 3-D visualization tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: By exploiting commodity computer gaming hardware, we have developed an application that can be run in the laboratory to facilitate rapid iteration through biological experiments. We combine unsupervised image analysis algorithms with an interactive visualization of the results. Our validation interface allows for each data set to be corrected to 100\% accuracy, ensuring that downstream data analysis is accurate and verifiable. Our tool is the first to combine all of these aspects, leveraging the synergies obtained by utilizing validation information from stereo visualization to improve the low level image processing tasks.},

	abstract = {The analysis of texture is an important subroutine in application areas as diverse as biology, medicine, robotics, and forensic science. While the last three decades have seen extensive research in algorithms to measure texture similarity, almost all existing methods require the careful setting of many parameters. There are many problems associated with a lot of parameters, the most obvious of which is that with many parameters to fit, it is very difficult to avoid overfitting. In this work, we propose to extend recent advances in Kolmogorov complexity-based similarity measures to texture matching problems. These Kolmogorov-based methods have been shown to be very useful in intrinsically discrete domains such as DNA, protein sequences, MIDI music, and natural languages; however, they are not well defined for real-valued data. To address this, we introduce a very simple idea, the Campana-Keogh (CK) video compression-based method for texture measures. These measures utilize video compressors to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity. Using the parameter-free CK method, we novely utilize lossy compression to create an efficient and robust parameter-lite texture similarity measure: the CK-1 distance measure. We demonstrate the utility of our measure with extensive empirical evaluations on real-world case studies drawn from nematology, arachnology, entomology, medicine, forensics, texture analysis benchmarks, and many other domains.

	abstract = {A growing body of literature suggests that there is an optimal size for software components. This means that components that are too small or too big will have a higher defect content (i.e., there is a U-shaped curve relating defect content to size). The U-shaped curve has become known as the "Goldilocks Conjecture." Recently, a cognitive theory has been proposed to explain this phenomenon and it has been expanded to characterize object-oriented software. This conjecture has wide implications for software engineering practice. It suggests 1) that designers should deliberately strive to design classes that are of the optimal size, 2) that program decomposition is harmful, and 3) that there exists a maximum (threshold) class size that should not be exceeded to ensure fewer faults in the software. The purpose of the current paper is to evaluate this conjecture for object-oriented systems. We first demonstrate that the claims of an optimal component/class size (1) above) and of smaller components/classes having a greater defect content (2) above) are due to a mathematical artifact in the analyses performed previously. We then empirically test the threshold effect claims of this conjecture (3) above). To our knowledge, the empirical test of size threshold effects for object-oriented systems has not been performed thus far. We performed an initial study with an industrial C++ system and repeated it twice on another C++ system and on a commercial Java application. Our results provide unambiguous evidence that there is no threshold effect of class size. We obtained the same result for three systems using four different size measures. These findings suggest that there is a simple continuous relationship between class size and faults, and that, optimal class size, smaller classes are better and threshold effects conjectures have no sound theoretical nor empirical basis},

Ca2+ imaging techniques permit time-lapse recordings of neuronal activity from large populations over weeks. However, without identifying the same neurons across imaging sessions (cell registration), longitudinal analysis of the neural code is restricted to population-level statistics. Accurate cell registration becomes challenging with increased numbers of cells, sessions, and inter-session intervals. Current cell registration practices, whether manual or automatic, do not quantitatively evaluate registration accuracy, possibly leading to data misinterpretation. We developed a probabilistic method that automatically registers cells across multiple sessions and estimates the registration confidence for each registered cell. Using large-scale Ca2+ imaging data recorded over weeks from the hippocampus and cortex of freely behaving mice, we show that our method performs more accurate registration than previously used routines, yielding estimated error rates {\textless}5\%, and that the registration is scalable for many sessions. Thus, our method allows reliable longitudinal analysis of the same neurons over long time periods.},

Neuronal stimulus selectivity is shaped by feedforward and recurrent excitatory-inhibitory interactions. In the auditory cortex (AC), parvalbumin- (PV) and somatostatin-positive (SOM) inhibitory interneurons differentially modulate frequency-dependent responses of excitatory neurons. Responsiveness of neurons in the AC to sound is also dependent on stimulus history. We found that the inhibitory effects of SOMs and PVs diverged as a function of adaptation to temporal repetition of tones. Prior to adaptation, suppressing either SOM or PV inhibition drove both increases and decreases in excitatory spiking activity. After adaptation, suppressing SOM activity caused predominantly disinhibitory effects, whereas suppressing PV activity still evoked bi-directional changes. SOM, but not PV-driven inhibition, dynamically modulated frequency tuning with adaptation. Unlike PV-driven inhibition, SOM-driven inhibition elicited gain-like increases in frequency tuning reflective of adaptation. Our findings suggest that distinct cortical interneurons differentially shape tuning to sensory stimuli across the neuronal receptive field, altering frequency selectivity of excitatory neurons during adaptation.},

Subcellular resolution imaging of the whole brain and subsequent image analysis are prerequisites for understanding anatomical and functional brain networks. Here, we have developed a very high-speed serial-sectioning imaging system named FAST (block-face serial microscopy tomography), which acquires high-resolution images of a whole mouse brain in a speed range comparable to that of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. FAST enables complete visualization of the brain at a resolution sufficient to resolve all cells and their subcellular structures. FAST renders unbiased quantitative group comparisons of normal and disease model brain cells for the whole brain at a high spatial resolution. Furthermore, FAST is highly scalable to non-human primate brains and human postmortem brain tissues, and can visualize neuronal projections in a whole adult marmoset brain. Thus, FAST provides new opportunities for global approaches that will allow for a better understanding of brain systems in multiple animal models and in human diseases.},

Here we draw parallels between neurobiological and computational mechanisms underlying transience. We propose that it is the interaction between persistence and transience that allows for intelligent decision-making in dynamic, noisy environments. Specifically, we argue that transience (1) enhances flexibility, by reducing the influence of outdated information on memory-guided decision-making, and (2) prevents overfitting to specific past events, thereby promoting generalization. According to this view, the goal of memory is not the transmission of information through time, per se. Rather, the goal of memory is to optimize decision-making. As such, transience is as important as persistence in mnemonic systems.},

Neuronal representations change as associations are learned between sensory stimuli and behavioral actions. However, it is poorly understood whether representations for learned associations stabilize in cortical association areas or continue to change following learning. We tracked the activity of posterior parietal cortex neurons for a month as mice stably performed a virtual-navigation task. The relationship between cells’ activity and task features was mostly stable on single days but underwent major reorganization over weeks. The neurons informative about task features (trial type and maze locations) changed across days. Despite changes in individual cells, the population activity had statistically similar properties each day and stable information for over a week. As mice learned additional associations, new activity patterns emerged in the neurons used for existing representations without greatly affecting the rate of change of these representations. We propose that dynamic neuronal activity patterns could balance plasticity for learning and stability for memory.},

During the stereotactical surgery procedure, the cannula has to be placed correctly in the x-y directions and also with respect to the injection point in the z-direction (deepness). However, the flat fixation base of available cannula holders doesn’t allow an easy, secure fixation onto the curve-shaped skull. We have developed a modified method for a better fixation of the cannula holder by using an easy-to-produce, skull-shaped silicone spacer as fixation adapter. We describe the application and its fast and reliable production in the lab. Superglue or cement is currently being used as the method of choice. However, the curve-shaped skull surface does not fit well with the flat and rigid cannula adapter which leads to fixation problems over time causing wide infusion channels and often also to leakage problems from intracerebrally applied agents towards the surface meninges. As another consequence of the inappropriate fixation, the cannula may loosen from the skull before the end of the experiment or it causes damage to the brain tissue, harming the animals with leading to a failure of the whole experiment. The easy-to-produce spacer facilitates the crucial step of long-term, stereotactic brain infusion experiments with intracerebral catheters in a highly secure and reproducible way.},

The preparation is produced by applying clear-drying dental cement to the intact mouse skull, followed by a glass coverslip to create a partially transparent imaging surface. Surgery time takes about 30min. A single set-screw provides a stable means of attachment (in relation to the measured lateral and axial resolution) for mesoscale assessment without obscuring the cortical field of view. We demonstrate the utility of this method by showing seed-pixel functional connectivity maps generated from spontaneous cortical activity of GCAMP6 signals in both awake and anesthetized mice in longitudinal studies of up to 2 months in duration. We propose that the intact skull preparation described here may be used for most longitudinal studies that do not require micron scale resolution and where cortical neural or vascular signals are recorded with intrinsic sensors or in transgenic mice expressing genetically encoded sensors of activity.},

Our method allows for video stabilization beyond the conventional filtering of camera paths that only suppresses high frequency jitter. We incorporate additional constraints on the path of the camera directly in our algorithm, allowing for stabilized and retargeted videos.

We propose a practical and robust approach of video stabilization that produces full-frame stabilized videos with good visual quality. While most previous methods end up with producing smaller size stabilized videos, our completion method can produce full-frame videos by naturally filling in missing image parts by locally aligning image data of neighboring frames. To achieve this, motion inpainting is proposed to enforce spatial and temporal consistency of the completion in both static and dynamic image areas. In addition, image quality in the stabilized video is enhanced with a new practical deblurring algorithm. Instead of estimating point spread functions, our method transfers and interpolates sharper image pixels of neighboring frames to increase the sharpness of the frame. The proposed video completion and deblurring methods enabled us to develop a complete video stabilizer which can naturally keep the original image quality in the stabilized videos. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed by extensive experiments over a wide variety of videos},

Such experiments typically generate terabytes of multidimensional image data, and thus they demand efficient computational solutions for data management, processing and analysis. We present protocols and software to tackle these steps, focusing on the imaging-based study of animal development. Our protocols facilitate (i) high-speed lossless data compression and content-based multiview image fusion optimized for multicore CPU architectures, reducing image data size 30–500-fold; (ii) automated large-scale cell tracking and segmentation; and (iii) visualization, editing and annotation of multiterabyte image data and cell-lineage reconstructions with tens of millions of data points. These software modules are open source. They provide high data throughput using a single computer workstation and are readily applicable to a wide spectrum of biological model systems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10219},
	abstract = {Two geometrical structures have been extensively studied for a manifold of probability distributions. One is based on the Fisher information metric, which is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the other is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which reflects the structure of the distance between random variables. Here, we propose a new information-geometrical theory that is a unified framework connecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We primarily considered a discrete case consisting of \$n\$ elements and studied the geometry of the probability simplex \$S\_\{n-1\}\$, which is the set of all probability distributions over \$n\$ elements. The Wasserstein distance was introduced in \$S\_\{n-1\}\$ by the optimal transportation of commodities from distribution \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{p\}\}\$ to distribution \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}\}\$, where \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{p\}\}\$, \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}\} {\textbackslash}in S\_\{n-1\}\$. We relaxed the optimal transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The optimal solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The entropy-relaxed optimal cost \$C(\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{p\}\}, \{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}\})\$ was computationally much less demanding than the original Wasserstein distance but does not define a distance because it is not minimized at \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{p\}\}=\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}\}\$. To define a proper divergence while retaining the computational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the manifold \$S\_\{n-1\} {\textbackslash}times S\_\{n-1\}\$ of optimal transportation plans. We fully explored the information geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation plans and subsequently constructed a new one-parameter family of divergences in \$S\_\{n-1\}\$ that are related to both the Wasserstein distance and the KL-divergence.},

It is a universal distance used to compare strings. This measure has also been used in computer graphics for image registration or viewpoint selection. However, there is no previous study on how the measure should be used: which compressor and image format are the most suitable. This paper presents a practical study of the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) applied to color images. The questions we try to answer are: Is NCD a suitable metric for image comparison? How robust is it to rotation, translation, and scaling? Which are the most adequate image formats and compression algorithms? The results of our study show that NCD can be used to address some of the selected image comparison problems, but care must be taken on the compressor and image format selected.},

Theoretically, compression-based similarity depends on the concept of Kolmogorov complexity but implementations require suitable (normal) compression algorithms. We argue that the approach is of interest for challenging image applications but we identify one obstacle: standard high-performance image compression methods are not normal, and normal methods such as Lempel-Ziv type algorithms might not perform well for images. To demonstrate the potential of compression-based similarity measures we propose an algorithm that is based on finite-context models and works directly on the intensity domain of the image.

Due to occlusions by targets and static objects, noisy segmentation and false alarms, one foreground region may not correspond to one target faithfully. Therefore the one-to-one assumption used in most data association algorithm is not always satisﬁed. Our method overcomes the one-to-one assumption by formulating the visual tracking problem in terms of ﬁnding the best spatial and temporal association of observations, which maximizes the consistency of both motion and appearance of trajectories. To avoid enumerating all possible solutions, we take a Data Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DD-MCMC) approach to sample the solution space efﬁciently. The sampling is driven by an informed proposal scheme controlled by a joint probability model combining motion and appearance. To make sure the Markov chain to converge to a desired distribution, we propose an automatic approach to determine the parameters in the target distribution. Comparative experiments with quantitative evaluations are provided.},

A motivating example is a problem of tracking multiple interacting nanoparticles imaged on video frames, where particles can aggregate into one particle or a particle can be split into multiple particles. Many existing multitarget tracking methods are capable of tracking non-interacting targets or tracking interacting targets of restricted degrees of interactions. The proposed formulation solves a multitarget tracking problem for general degrees of inter-object interactions. The formulation is in the form of a binary integer programming problem. We propose a polynomial time solution approach that can obtain a good relaxation solution of the binary integer programming, so the approach can be applied for multitarget tracking problems of a moderate size (for hundreds of targets over tens of time frames). The resulting solution is always integral and obtains a better duality gap than the simple linear relaxation solution of the corresponding problem. The proposed method was validated through applications to simulated multitarget tracking problems and a real multitarget tracking problem.},

Once the graph is adequately connected, the system traverses the graph, analyzes the data dependencies, and constructs an execution schedule. It then repeatedly executes the schedule, mapping graph nodes to specific hardware resources as needed. We discuss the overall architecture of the system, describe the class of hardware devices to which it is applicable, and then present an implementation for the Datacube MV 20.

	abstract = {In this technical demonstration, we showcase the MindFinder system \$-\$ a novel image search engine. Different from existing interactive image search engines, most of which only provide image-level relevance feedback, MindFinder enables users to sketch and tag query images at object level. By considering the image database as a huge repository, MindFinder is able to help users present and refine their initial thoughts in their mind, and finally turn thoughts to a beautiful image(s). Multiple actions are enabled for users to flexibly design their queries in a bilateral interactive manner by leveraging the whole image database, including tagging, refining query by dragging and dropping objects from search results, as well as editing objects. After each action, the search results will be updated in real time to provide users up-to-date materials to further formulate the query. By the deliberate but easy design of the query, MindFinder not only tries to enable users to present on the query panel whatever they are imagining, but also returns to users the most similar images to the picture in users' mind. By scaling up the image database to 10 million, MindFinder has the potential to reveal whatever in users' mind, that is where the name MindFinder comes from.},

	abstract = {Neural networks that compute over graph structures are a natural fit for problems in a variety of domains, including natural language (parse trees) and cheminformatics (molecular graphs). However, since the computation graph has a different shape and size for every input, such networks do not directly support batched training or inference. They are also difficult to implement in popular deep learning libraries, which are based on static data-flow graphs. We introduce a technique called dynamic batching, which not only batches together operations between different input graphs of dissimilar shape, but also between different nodes within a single input graph. The technique allows us to create static graphs, using popular libraries, that emulate dynamic computation graphs of arbitrary shape and size. We further present a high-level library of compositional blocks that simplifies the creation of dynamic graph models. Using the library, we demonstrate concise and batch-wise parallel implementations for a variety of models from the literature.},

Visual overviews that show temporal patterns of paper publication and citation links among papers can help researchers and analysts to see the rate of growth of topics, identify key papers, and understand influences across subdisciplines. This article applies a novel network-visualization tool based on meaningful layouts of nodes to present research fronts and show citation links that indicate influences across research fronts. To demonstrate the value of two-dimensional layouts with multiple regions and user control of link visibility, we conducted a design-oriented, preliminary case study with 6 domain experts over a 4-month period. The main benefits were being able (a) to easily identify key papers and see the increasing number of papers within a research front, and (b) to quickly see the strength and direction of influence across related research fronts. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature—an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981–2004) and terrorism (1990–2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed. A number of challenges and opportunities for future studies are identified. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We proposed a HITS based influence analysis on graphs that represent the star relationship between Github users and repositories. A weighted version of HITS is applied to the overall star graph, and generates a different set of top influential repositories other than the results from standard version of HITS algorithm.

Therefore, how to use frequent classes to help learning rare classes for which it is harder to collect the training data is an open question. Learning with shared information is an emerging topic in machine learning, computer vision and multimedia analysis. There are different levels of components that can be shared during concept modeling and machine learning stages, such as sharing generic object parts, sharing attributes, sharing transformations, sharing regularization parameters and sharing training examples, etc. Regarding the specific methods, multi-task learning, transfer learning and deep learning can be seen as using different strategies to share information.

  abstract  = {Neurophysiological recording in alert monkeys requires the creation of a permanent aperture in the skull for repeated insertion of microelectrodes. Most laboratories use polymethyl methacrylate to attach a recording chamber over the skull opening. Here, we describe a titanium chamber that fastens to the skull with screws, using no polymethyl methacrylate. The gap between the base of the chamber and the skull is filled with hydroxyapatite, forming a watertight gasket. As the chamber base osseointegates with the skull, the hydroxyapatite is replaced with bone. Rather than having a finite lifetime, the recording chamber becomes more firmly anchored the longer it is in place. It has a small footprint, low profile, and needs little maintenance to control infection. Toilette consists of occasional application of betadine to clean the scalp margin, followed by application of neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin ointment. Antibiotic is also placed inside the chamber to suppress bacterial proliferation. Thickening of the dura within the chamber can be prevented by regular application of mitocycin C and/or bevacizumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor. By conducting an e-mail survey, this protocol for chamber maintenance was compared with procedures used in 37 other vision research laboratories. Refinement of appliances and techniques used for recordings in awake monkeys promises to increase the pace of scientific discovery and to benefit animal welfare.},

The crucial material-dependent problem is developing microelectrodes that record neural activity from the same neurons for years with high fidelity and reliability. Here, we report the development of an integrated composite electrode consisting of a carbon-fibre core, a poly(p-xylylene)-based thin-film coating that acts as a dielectric barrier and that is functionalized to control intrinsic biological processes, and a poly(thiophene)-based recording pad. The resulting implants are an order of magnitude smaller than traditional recording electrodes, and more mechanically compliant with brain tissue. They were found to elicit much reduced chronic reactive tissue responses and enabled single-neuron recording in acute and early chronic experiments in rats. This technology, taking advantage of new composites, makes possible highly selective and stealthy neural interface devices towards realizing long-lasting implants.},

The biochemical step is mediated by a complex network of signaling proteins in spines. Two-photon imaging techniques combined with two-photon glutamate uncaging allows researchers to induce and quantify structural plasticity in single dendritic spines. However, this method is laborious and slow, making it unsuitable for high throughput screening of factors necessary for structural plasticity. Here we introduce a MATLAB-based module built for Scanimage to automatically track, image, and stimulate multiple dendritic spines. We implemented an electrically tunable lens in combination with a drift correction algorithm to rapidly and continuously track targeted spines and correct sample movements. With a straightforward user interface to design custom multi-position experiments, we were able to adequately image and produce targeted plasticity in multiple dendritic spines using glutamate uncaging. Our methods are inexpensive, open source, and provides up to a five-fold increase in throughput for quantifying structural plasticity of dendritic spines.},

  abstract = {Neural stimulation with high spatial and temporal precision is desirable both for studying the real-time dynamics of neural networks and for prospective clinical treatment of neurological diseases. Optical stimulation of genetically targeted neurons expressing the light sensitive channel protein Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) has recently been reported as a means for millisecond temporal control of neuronal spiking activities with cell-type selectivity. This offers the prospect of enabling local delivery of optical stimulation and the simultaneous monitoring of the neural activity by electrophysiological means, both in the vicinity of and distant to the stimulation site. We report here a novel dual-modality hybrid device, which consists of a tapered coaxial optical waveguide ('optrode') integrated into a 100 element intra-cortical multi-electrode recording array. We first demonstrate the dual optical delivery and electrical recording capability of the single optrode in in vitro preparations of mouse retina, photo-stimulating the native retinal photoreceptors while recording light-responsive activities from ganglion cells. The dual-modality array device was then used in ChR2 transfected mouse brain slices. Specifically, epileptiform events were reliably optically triggered by the optrode and their spatiotemporal patterns were simultaneously recorded by the multi-electrode array.},

  abstract = {Multiple extracellular microelectrodes (multi-electrode arrays, or MEAs) effectively record rapidly varying neural signals, and can also be used for electrical stimulation. Multi-electrode recording can serve as artificial output (efferents) from a neural system, while complex spatially and temporally targeted stimulation can serve as artificial input (afferents) to the neuronal network. Multi-unit or local field potential (LFP) recordings can not only be used to control real world artifacts, such as prostheses, computers or robots, but can also trigger or alter subsequent stimulation. Real-time feedback stimulation may serve to modulate or normalize aberrant neural activity, to induce plasticity, or to serve as artificial sensory input. Despite promising closed-loop applications, commercial electrophysiology systems do not yet take advantage of the bidirectional capabilities of multi-electrodes, especially for use in freely moving animals. We addressed this lack of tools for closing the loop with NeuroRighter, an open-source system including recording hardware, stimulation hardware, and control software with a graphical user interface. The integrated system is capable of multi-electrode recording and simultaneous patterned microstimulation (triggered by recordings) with minimal stimulation artifact. The potential applications of closed-loop systems as research tools and clinical treatments are broad; we provide one example where epileptic activity recorded by a multi-electrode probe is used to trigger targeted stimulation, via that probe, to freely moving rodents.},

Changes in membrane depolarization, particularly action potentials, are the most important features of neural physiology to extract, although ions, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, second messengers, and the activation state of specific proteins are also crucial. Modern fluorescence microscopy provides the basis for such activity mapping, through multi-photon imaging and other optical schemes. Probes remain the rate-limiting step for progress in this field: they should be bright and photostable, and ideally come in multiple colors. Only protein-based reagents permit chronic imaging from genetically specified cells. Here we review recent progress in the design, optimization and deployment of genetically encoded indicators for calcium ions (a proxy for action potentials), membrane potential, and neurotransmitters.

We present a modular approach for analyzing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal ensembles. Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. Our approach relies on a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization that expresses the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity as the product of a spatial matrix that encodes the spatial footprint of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. This framework is combined with a novel constrained deconvolution approach that extracts estimates of neural activity from fluorescence traces, to create a spatiotemporal processing algorithm that requires minimal parameter tuning. We demonstrate the general applicability of our method by applying it to in vitro and in vivo multi-neuronal imaging data, whole-brain light-sheet imaging data, and dendritic imaging data.},

Current software-based identification methods of neural cells generally fall into two applications: (1) segmentation of cell nuclei in high-density constructs or (2) tracing of cell neurites in single cell investigations. We have developed novel methodologies to permit the systematic identification of populations of neuronal somata possessing rich morphological detail and dense neurite arborization throughout thick tissue or 3-D in vitro constructs. The image analysis incorporates several novel automated features for the discrimination of neurites and somata by initially classifying features in 2-D and merging these classifications into 3-D objects; the 3-D reconstructions automatically identify and adjust for over and under segmentation errors. Additionally, the platform provides for software-assisted error corrections to further minimize error. These features attain very accurate cell boundary identifications to handle a wide range of morphological complexities. We validated these tools using confocal z-stacks from thick 3-D neural constructs where neuronal somata had varying degrees of neurite arborization and complexity, achieving an accuracy of ≥95\%. We demonstrated the robustness of these algorithms in a more complex arena through the automated segmentation of neural cells in ex vivo brain slices. These novel methods surpass previous techniques by improving the robustness and accuracy by: (1) the ability to process neurites and somata, (2) bidirectional segmentation correction, and (3) validation via software-assisted user input. This 3-D image analysis platform provides valuable tools for the unbiased analysis of neural tissue or tissue surrogates within a 3-D context, appropriate for the study of multi-dimensional cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions.},

Major limitations when decreasing electrode size in dense arrays are increased noise level and low charge injection capability. Nanostructuration of the electrode sites on MEAs presents an efficient way to overcome these problems by decreasing the impedance of the electrode/solution interface. Here, we review different techniques used to achieve this goal including template assisted electrodeposition for generating macro- and mesoporous films, immobilization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and deposition of conducting polymers onto microelectrodes. When tested during in vitro and in vivo measurements, nanostructured MEAs display improved sensitivity during recording of neuronal activity together with a higher efficiency in the stimulation process compared to conventional microelectrodes.},

The macroscope incorporates epi-illumination, a 0.4 numerical aperture, and a 40 mm working distance for imaging wide fields in the range of 1.5–20 mm in diameter. At magnifications of 1 × to 2.5 ×, fluorescence images acquired with the macroscope were 100–700 times brighter than those obtained with commercial microscope objectives at similar magnifications. In several biological applications, the improved light collection efficiency (20-fold, typical) not only minimized bleaching effects, but, in concert with improved illumination throughput (15-fold, typical), significantly enhanced object visibility as well. Reduced phototoxicity and increased signal-to-noise ratios were observed in the in vivo real-time optical imaging of cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes. Furthermore, the macroscope has a depth of field which is 5–10 times thinner than that of a conventional low-power microscope. This shallow depth of field has facilitated the imaging of cortical architecture based on activity-dependent intrinsic cortical signals in the living primate brain. In these reflection measurements large artifacts from the surface blood vessels, which were observed with conventional lenses, were eliminated with the macroscope.},

Continuous technological advancement in the field has created a need for new control software that is flexible enough to support the biological researcher with innovative imaging techniques and provide the developer with a solid platform for quickly and easily implementing new extensions. Here, we introduce HelioScan, a software package written in LabVIEW, as a platform serving this dual role. HelioScan is designed as a collection of components that can be flexibly assembled into microscope control software tailored to the particular hardware and functionality requirements. Moreover, HelioScan provides a software framework, within which new functionality can be implemented in a quick and structured manner. A specific HelioScan application assembles at run-time from individual software components, based on user-definable configuration files. Due to its component-based architecture, HelioScan can exploit synergies of multiple developers working in parallel on different components in a community effort. We exemplify the capabilities and versatility of HelioScan by demonstrating several in vivo brain imaging modes, including camera-based intrinsic optical signal imaging for functional mapping of cortical areas, standard two-photon laser-scanning microscopy using galvanometric mirrors, and high-speed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging using either acousto-optic deflectors or a resonant scanner. We recommend HelioScan as a convenient software framework for the in vivo imaging community.},

To date, no publicly available software exists for straightforward analysis of stimulus-triggered two-photon imaging experiments. In addition, the increasing data rates of two-photon acquisition systems imply increasing cost of computing hardware required for in-memory analysis. Here we present a Matlab toolbox, FocusStack, for simple and efficient analysis of two-photon calcium imaging stacks on consumer-level hardware, with minimal memory footprint. We also present a Matlab toolbox, StimServer, for generation and sequencing of visual stimuli, designed to be triggered over a network link from a two-photon acquisition system. FocusStack is compatible out of the box with several existing two-photon acquisition systems, and is simple to adapt to arbitrary binary file formats. Analysis tools such as stack alignment for movement correction, automated cell detection and peri-stimulus time histograms are already provided, and further tools can be easily incorporated. Both packages are available as publicly-accessible source-code repositories1.},

  abstract   = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of “primary states” is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit “criticality,” i.e., the property of being poised at a “critical” point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state.},

  abstract = {Information theory is a practical and theoretical framework developed for the study of communication over noisy channels. Its probabilistic basis and capacity to relate statistical structure to function make it ideally suited for studying information flow in the nervous system. As a framework it has a number of useful properties: it provides a general measure sensitive to any relationship, not only linear effects; its quantities have meaningful units which in many cases allow direct comparison between different experiments; and it can be used to study how much information can be gained by observing neural responses in single experimental trials, rather than in averages over multiple trials. A variety of information theoretic quantities are in common use in neuroscience - including the Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and mutual information. In this entry, we introduce and define these quantities. Further details on how these quantities can be estimated in practice are provided in the entry "Estimation of Information-Theoretic Quantities" and examples of application of these techniques in neuroscience can be found in the entry "Applications of Information-Theoretic Quantities in Neuroscience".},

To demonstrate the performance of TPS, we monitor the calcium dynamics distributed across an entire juvenile rat hippocampus (\&gt;1.5 mm), at scan rates of 100 Hz, with single cell resolution and single action potential sensitivity. Our strategy for fast, efficient two-photon microscopy over spatially extended regions provides a particularly attractive solution for monitoring neuronal population activity in thick tissue, without sacrificing the signal-to-noise ratio or high spatial resolution associated with standard two-photon microscopy.

Here we present a microscope that rapidly sections a three-dimensional volume using a thin illumination sheet whose position is rigidly coupled to the objective and aligned with its focal plane. We demonstrate that this approach allows exceptionally low-noise imaging of large neuronal populations at pixel rates at least 100-fold higher than with LSM.

Proof-of-principle experiments in mouse barrel cortex demonstrate interrogation of the same neuronal population during different behavioral states and targeting of neuronal ensembles based on their functional signature. This approach extends the optogenetic toolkit beyond the specificity obtained with genetic or viral approaches, enabling high-throughput, flexible and long-term optical interrogation of functionally defined neural circuits with single-cell and single-spike resolution in the mouse brain in vivo.},

This was done without the use of dental resin or orthopedic cement, as these modes of fixation exert a detrimental effect on the bone. The implants were made of titanium or tekapeek and anchored to the skull with titanium screws. Two adult macaque monkeys were initially implanted with the head fixation device several months previous to electrophysiological investigation, to allow optimal osseous-integration, including growth of the bone above the implant's footplate. In a second step, the chronic recording chamber was implanted above the brain region of interest. The present study proposes two original approaches for both implants. First, based on a CT scan of the monkey, a plastic replicate of the skull was obtained in the form of a 3D print, used to accurately shape and position the two implants. This would ensure a perfect match with the skull surface. Second, the part of the implants in contact with the bone was coated with hydroxyapatite, presenting chemical similarity to natural bone, thus promoting excellent osseous-integration. The longevity of the implants used here was 4 years for the head fixation device and 1.5 years for the chronic chamber. There were no adverse events and daily care was easy. This is clear evidence that the present implanting strategy was successful and provokes less discomfort to the animals.},

Concurrent sensing and stimulation are needed to maximize usable neural data, minimize time delays for closed-loop actuation, and investigate the instantaneous response to stimulation. Current systems lack concurrent sensing and stimulation primarily because of stimulation interference to neural signals of interest. While careful design of high performance amplifiers has proved useful to reduce disturbances in the system, stimulation continues to contaminate neural sensing due to biological effects like tissue-electrode impedance mismatch and constraints on stimulation parameters needed to deliver therapy. In this work we describe systematic methods to mitigate the effect of stimulation through a combination of sensing hardware, stimulation parameter selection, and classification algorithms that counter residual stimulation disturbances. To validate these methods we implemented and tested a completely implantable system for over one year in a large animal model of epilepsy. The system proved capable of measuring and detecting seizure activity in the hippocampus both during and after stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate an embedded algorithm that actuates neural modulation in response to seizure detection during stimulation, validating the capability to detect bioelectrical markers in the presence of therapy and titrate it appropriately. The capability to detect neural states in the presence of stimulation and optimally titrate therapy is a key innovation required for generalizing closed-loop neural systems for multiple disease states.},

  abstract  = {Fluorescent calcium sensors are widely used to image neural activity. Using structure-based mutagenesis and neuron-based screening, we developed a family of ultrasensitive protein calcium sensors (GCaMP6) that outperformed other sensors in cultured neurons and in zebrafish, flies and mice in vivo. In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5–40-µm long). GCaMP6 sensors thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits over multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

  abstract = {High frequency deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (deep brain stimulation, DBS) relieves many of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease in humans and animal models. Although the treatment has seen widespread use, its therapeutic mechanism remains paradoxical. The subthalamic nucleus is excitatory, so its stimulation at rates higher than its normal firing rate should worsen the disease by increasing subthalamic excitation of the globus pallidus. The therapeutic effectiveness of DBS is also frequency and intensity sensitive, and the stimulation must be periodic; aperiodic stimulation at the same mean rate is ineffective. These requirements are not adequately explained by existing models, whether based on firing rate changes or on reduced bursting. Here we report modeling studies suggesting that high frequency periodic excitation of the subthalamic nucleus may act by desynchronizing the firing of neurons in the globus pallidus, rather than by changing the firing rate or pattern of individual cells. Globus pallidus neurons are normally desynchronized, but their activity becomes correlated in Parkinson’s disease. Periodic stimulation may induce chaotic desynchronization by interacting with the intrinsic oscillatory mechanism of globus pallidus neurons. Our modeling results suggest a mechanism of action of DBS and a pathophysiology of Parkinsonism in which synchrony, rather than firing rate, is the critical pathological feature.},

Recording the activity of large populations of neurons is an important step toward understanding the emergent function of neural circuits. Here we present a simple holographic method to simultaneously perform two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal populations across multiple areas and layers of mouse cortex in vivo. We use prior knowledge of neuronal locations, activity sparsity, and a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm to extract signals from neurons imaged simultaneously and located in different focal planes or fields of view. Our laser multiplexing approach is simple and fast, and could be used as a general method to image the activity of neural circuits in three dimensions across multiple areas in the brain.},

  abstract = {Light control of motility behavior (phototaxis and photophobic responses) in green flagellate algae is mediated by sensory rhodopsins homologous to phototaxis receptors and light-driven ion transporters in prokaryotic organisms. In the phototaxis process, excitation of the algal sensory rhodopsins leads to generation of transmembrane photoreceptor currents. When expressed in animal cells, the algal phototaxis receptors function as light-gated cation channels, which has earned them the name “channelrhodopsins.” Channelrhodopsins have become useful molecular tools for light control of cellular activity. Only four channelrhodopsins, identified in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri, have been reported so far. By screening light-induced currents among algal species, we identified that the phylogenetically distant flagellate Mesostigma viride showed photoelectrical responses in vivo with properties suggesting a channelrhodopsin especially promising for optogenetic use. We cloned an M. viride channelrhodopsin, MChR1, and studied its channel activity upon heterologous expression. Action spectra in HEK293 cells match those of the photocurrents observed in M. viride cells. Comparison of the more divergent MChR1 sequence to the previously studied phylogenetically clustered homologs and study of several MChR1 mutants refine our understanding of the sequence determinants of channelrhodopsin function. We found that MChR1 has the most red-shifted and pH-independent spectral sensitivity so far reported, matches or surpasses known channelrhodopsins’ channel kinetics features, and undergoes minimal inactivation upon sustained illumination. This combination of properties makes MChR1 a promising candidate for optogenetic applications.
IMPORTANCE Channelrhodopsins that function as phototaxis receptors in flagellate algae have recently come into the spotlight as genetically encoded single-molecule optical switches for turning on neuronal firing or other cellular processes, a technique called “optogenetics.” Only one of four currently known channelrhodopsins is widely used in optogenetics, although electrical currents recorded in diverse flagellates suggest the existence of a large variety of such proteins. We applied a strategy for the search for new channelrhodopsins with desirable characteristics by measuring rhodopsin-mediated photocurrents in microalgae, which helped us identify MChR1, a new member of the channelrhodopsin family. MChR1 exhibits several sought-after characteristics and thus expands the available optogenetic toolbox. The divergence of the MChR1 sequence from those of the four known channelrhodopsins contributes to our understanding of diversity in the primary structures of this subfamily of sensory rhodopsins.},

  abstract = {Optogenetics, the ability to use light to activate and silence specific neuron types within neural networks in vivo and in vitro, is revolutionizing neuroscientists' capacity to understand how defined neural circuit elements contribute to normal and pathological brain functions. Typically, awake behaving experiments are conducted by inserting an optical fiber into the brain, tethered to a remote laser, or by utilizing an implanted light-emitting diode (LED), tethered to a remote power source. A fully wireless system would enable chronic or longitudinal experiments where long duration tethering is impractical, and would also support high-throughput experimentation. However, the high power requirements of light sources (LEDs, lasers), especially in the context of the extended illumination periods often desired in experiments, precludes battery-powered approaches from being widely applicable. We have developed a headborne device weighing 2 g capable of wirelessly receiving power using a resonant RF power link and storing the energy in an adaptive supercapacitor circuit, which can algorithmically control one or more headborne LEDs via a microcontroller. The device can deliver approximately 2 W of power to the LEDs in steady state, and 4.3 W in bursts. We also present an optional radio transceiver module (1 g) which, when added to the base headborne device, enables real-time updating of light delivery protocols; dozens of devices can be controlled simultaneously from one computer. We demonstrate use of the technology to wirelessly drive cortical control of movement in mice. These devices may serve as prototypes for clinical ultra-precise neural prosthetics that use light as the modality of biological control.},

Here we describe an automated sorting procedure that combines independent component analysis and image segmentation for extracting cells’ locations and their dynamics with minimal human supervision. In validation studies using simulated data, automated sorting significantly improved estimation of cellular signals compared to conventional analysis based on image regions of interest. We used automated procedures to analyze data recorded by two-photon Ca2+ imaging in the cerebellar vermis of awake behaving mice. Our analysis yielded simultaneous Ca2+ activity traces for up to {\textgreater}100 Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia from single recordings. Using this approach, we found microzones of Purkinje cells that were stable across behavioral states and in which synchronous Ca2+-spiking rose significantly during locomotion.},

Bypassing the immune response to maintain a stable recording interface remains a challenge. Companies and researchers are continuously altering the material compositions and geometries of the arrays in order to discover a combination that allows for a chronic and stable electrode–tissue interface. From this interface, they wish to obtain consistent quality recordings and a stable, low impedance pathway for charge injection over extended periods of time. Despite numerous efforts, no microelectrode array design has managed to evade the host immune response and remain fully functional. This study is an initial effort comparing several microelectrode arrays with fundamentally different configurations for use in an implantable epilepsy prosthesis. Specifically, NeuroNexus (Michigan) probes, Cyberkinetics (Utah) Silicon and Iridium Oxide arrays, ceramic-based thin-film microelectrode arrays (Drexel), and Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) microwire arrays are evaluated over a 31-day period in an animal model. Microelectrodes are compared in implanted rats through impedance, charge capacity, signal-to-noise ratio, recording stability, and elicited immune response. Results suggest significant variability within and between microelectrode types with no clear superior array. Some applications for the microelectrode arrays are suggested based on data collected throughout the longitudinal study. Additionally, specific limitations of assaying biological phenomena and comparing fundamentally different microelectrode arrays in a highly variable system are discussed with suggestions on how to improve the reliability of observed results and steps needed to develop a more standardized microelectrode design.},

With the high spatial temporal precision, optogenetic tools have enabled new ways to probe the causal role of specific cells in neural computation and behavior.

  abstract = {Rapid prototyping (RP) is a useful method for designing and fabricating a wide variety of devices used for neuroscience research. The present study confirms the utility of using fused deposition modeling, a specific form of RP, to produce three devices commonly used for basic science experimentation. The accuracy and precision of the RP method varies according to the type and quality of the printer as well as the thermoplastic substrate. The printer was capable of creating device channels with a minimum diameter of 0.4 or 0.6 mm depending on the orientation of fabrication. RP enabled the computer-aided design and fabrication of three custom devices including a cortical recording/stroke induction platform capable of monitoring electrophysiological function during ischemic challenge. In addition to the recording platform, two perfusion chambers and a cranial window device were replicated with sub-millimeter precision. The ability to repeatedly modify the design of each device with minimal effort and low turn-around time is helpful for oft-unpredictable experimental conditions. Results obtained from validation studies using both the cortical recording platform and perfusion chamber did not vary from previous results using traditional hand-fabricated or commercially available devices. Combined with computer-aided design, rapid prototyping is an excellent alternative for developing and fabricating custom devices for neuroscience research.},

  abstract   = {Intravital microscopy such as in vivo imaging of brain dynamics is often performed with custom-built microscope setups controlled by custom-written software to meet specific requirements. Continuous technological advancement in the field has created a need for new control software that is flexible enough to support the biological researcher with innovative imaging techniques and provide the developer with a solid platform for quickly and easily implementing new extensions. Here, we introduce HelioScan, a software package written in LabVIEW, as a platform serving this dual role. HelioScan is designed as a collection of components that can be flexibly assembled into microscope control software tailored to the particular hardware and functionality requirements. Moreover, HelioScan provides a software framework, within which new functionality can be implemented in a quick and structured manner. A specific HelioScan application assembles at run-time from individual software components, based on user-definable configuration files. Due to its component-based architecture, HelioScan can exploit synergies of multiple developers working in parallel on different components in a community effort. We exemplify the capabilities and versatility of HelioScan by demonstrating several in vivo brain imaging modes, including camera-based intrinsic optical signal imaging for functional mapping of cortical areas, standard two-photon laser-scanning microscopy using galvanometric mirrors, and high-speed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging using either acousto-optic deflectors or a resonant scanner. We recommend HelioScan as a convenient software framework for the in vivo imaging community.},

  abstract = {In the last few years two-photon microscopy has been used to perform in vivo high spatial resolution imaging of neurons, glial cells and vascular structures in the intact neocortex. Recently, in parallel to its applications in imaging, multi-photon absorption has been used as a tool for the selective disruption of neural processes and blood vessels in living animals. In this review we present some basic features of multi-photon nanosurgery and we illustrate the advantages offered by this novel methodology in neuroscience research. We show how the spatial localization of multi-photon excitation can be exploited to perform selective lesions on cortical neurons in living mice expressing fluorescent proteins. This methodology is applied to disrupt a single neuron without causing any visible collateral damage to the surrounding structures. The spatial precision of this method allows to dissect single processes as well as individual dendritic spines, preserving the structural integrity of the main neuronal arbor. The same approach can be used to breach the blood-brain barrier through a targeted photo-disruption of blood vessels walls. We show how the vascular system can be perturbed through laser ablation leading toward two different models of stroke: intravascular clot and extravasation. Following the temporal evolution of the injured system (either a neuron or a blood vessel) through time lapse in vivo imaging, the physiological response of the target structure and the rearrangement of the surrounding area can be characterized. Multi-photon nanosurgery in live brain represents a useful tool to produce different models of neurodegenerative disease.},

Smoking and overeating are compulsory habits that are difficult to stop. Several studies have shown involvement of the nucleus accumbens in these and other addictive behaviors. In this case report, we describe a patient who quit smoking and lost weight without any effort, and we review the underlying mechanisms of action.


CLINICAL PRESENTATION

A 47-year-old woman presented with chronic treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, nicotine dependence, and obesity.


INTERVENTION

The patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Unintended, effortless, and simultaneous smoking cessation and weight loss were observed.


CONCLUSION

This study supports the idea of compulsivity with common circuitry in the processing of diverse rewards and suggests that deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens could be a possible treatment of patients with a dependency not responding to currently available treatments.},

  abstract   = {Background—After the recent cloning of light-sensitive ion channels and their expression in mammalian cells, a new field, optogenetics, emerged in neuroscience, allowing for precise perturbations of neural circuits by light. However, functionality of optogenetic tools has not been fully explored outside neuroscience; and a non-viral, non-embryogenesis based strategy for optogenetics has not been shown before. Methods and Results—We demonstrate the utility of optogenetics to cardiac muscle by a tandem cell unit (TCU) strategy, where non-excitable cells carry exogenous light-sensitive ion channels, and when electrically coupled to cardiomyocytes, produce optically-excitable heart tissue. A stable channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) expressing cell line was developed, characterized and used as a cell delivery system. The TCU strategy was validated in vitro in cell pairs with adult canine myocytes (for a wide range of coupling strengths) and in cardiac syncytium with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. For the first time, we combined optical excitation and optical imaging to capture light-triggered muscle contractions and high-resolution propagation maps of light-triggered electrical waves, found to be quantitatively indistinguishable from electrically-triggered waves. Conclusions—Our results demonstrate feasibility to control excitation and contraction in cardiac muscle by light using the TCU approach. Optical pacing in this case uses less energy, offers superior spatiotemporal control, remote access and can serve not only as an elegant tool in arrhythmia research, but may form the basis for a new generation of light-driven cardiac pacemakers and muscle actuators. The TCU strategy is extendable to (non-viral) stem cell therapy and is directly relevant to in vivo applications.},

Continuous high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a widely used therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) management. However, the mechanisms underlying DBS effects remain enigmatic and are the subject of an ongoing debate. Here, we present and test a closed-loop stimulation strategy for PD in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) primate model of PD. Application of pallidal closed-loop stimulation leads to dissociation between changes in basal ganglia (BG) discharge rates and patterns, providing insights into PD pathophysiology. Furthermore, cortico-pallidal closed-loop stimulation has a significantly greater effect on akinesia and on cortical and pallidal discharge patterns than standard open-loop DBS and matched control stimulation paradigms. Thus, closed-loop DBS paradigms, by modulating pathological oscillatory activity rather than the discharge rate of the BG-cortical networks, may afford more effective management of advanced PD. Such strategies have the potential to be effective in additional brain disorders in which a pathological neuronal discharge pattern can be recognized.},

In this study, we propose and apply a procedure to statistically assess transfer entropies by one-sided tests. We introduce to null models of vanishing correlations for time series with memory. We implemented them in an OpenMP-based, parallelized C++ package for multi-core CPUs. Using template meta-programming, we enable a compromise between memory and run time efficiency.},

Inspired by the ability of communication to improve targeting in biological systems, such as inflammatory-cell recruitment to sites of disease, we construct systems where synthetic biological and nanotechnological components communicate to amplify disease targeting in vivo. These systems are composed of ‘signalling’ modules (nanoparticles or engineered proteins) that target tumours and then locally activate the coagulation cascade to broadcast tumour location to clot-targeted ‘receiving’ nanoparticles in circulation that carry a diagnostic or therapeutic cargo, thereby amplifying their delivery. We show that communicating nanoparticle systems can be composed of multiple types of signalling and receiving modules, can transmit information through multiple molecular pathways in coagulation, can operate autonomously and can target over 40 times higher doses of chemotherapeutics to tumours than non-communicating controls.},

  abstract = {We report a technique for two-photon fluorescence imaging with cellular resolution in awake, behaving mice with minimal motion artifact. The apparatus combines an upright, table-mounted two-photon microscope with a spherical treadmill consisting of a large, air-supported Styrofoam ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows, are head restrained under the objective while their limbs rest on the ball's upper surface. Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless. Image sequences demonstrate that running-associated brain motion is limited to ∼2-5 μm. In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for postprocessing. Behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations were routinely measured, with an estimated motion-induced false positive error rate of {\textless}5\%.},

In particular, because current open-loop DBS strategies based on fixed stimulation settings leave the typical parkinsonian motor fluctuations and rapid symptom variations partly uncontrolled, research has for several years focused on developing novel "closed-loop" or "adaptive" DBS (aDBS) systems. aDBS consists of a simple closed-loop model designed to measure and analyze a control variable reflecting the patient's clinical condition to elaborate new stimulation settings and send them to an "intelligent" implanted stimulator. The major problem in developing an aDBS system is choosing the ideal control variable for feedback. Here we review current evidence on the advantages of neurosignal-controlled aDBS that uses local field potentials (LFPs) as a control variable, and describe the technology already available to create new aDBS systems, and the potential benefits of aDBS for patients with Parkinson's disease.},

Treatment-resistant depression is a severely disabling disorder with no proven treatment options once multiple medications, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy have failed. Based on our preliminary observation that the subgenual cingulate region (Brodmann area 25) is metabolically overactive in treatment-resistant depression, we studied whether the application of chronic deep brain stimulation to modulate BA25 could reduce this elevated activity and produce clinical benefit in six patients with refractory depression. Chronic stimulation of white matter tracts adjacent to the subgenual cingulate gyrus was associated with a striking and sustained remission of depression in four of six patients. Antidepressant effects were associated with a marked reduction in local cerebral blood flow as well as changes in downstream limbic and cortical sites, measured using positron emission tomography. These results suggest that disrupting focal pathological activity in limbic-cortical circuits using electrical stimulation of the subgenual cingulate white matter can effectively reverse symptoms in otherwise treatment-resistant depression.},

The seeds are then used as starting points for watershed segmentation of the gradient magnitude image. The fully automatic seeding is done in a generous fashion, so that at least one seed will be set in each foreground object. If more than one seed is placed in a single object, the watershed segmentation will lead to an initial over-segmentation, i.e. a boundary is created where there is no strong edge. Thus, the result of the initial segmentation is further refined by merging based on the gradient magnitude along the boundary separating neighbouring objects. This step also makes it easy to remove objects with poor contrast. As a final step, clusters of nuclei are separated, based on the shape of the cluster. The number of input parameters to the full segmentation procedure is only five. These parameters can be set manually using a test image and thereafter be used on a large number of images created under similar imaging conditions. This automated system was verified by comparison with manual counts from the same image fields. About 90\% correct segmentation was achieved for two- as well as three-dimensional images.},

  abstract = {The clock speeds of modern computer processors have nearly plateaued in the past 5 years. Consequently, neural prosthetic systems that rely on processing large quantities of data in a short period of time face a bottleneck, in that it may not be possible to process all of the data recorded from an electrode array with high channel counts and bandwidth, such as electrocorticographic grids or other implantable systems. Therefore, in this study a method of using the processing capabilities of a graphics card [graphics processing unit (GPU)] was developed for real-time neural signal processing of a brain–computer interface (BCI). The NVIDIA CUDA system was used to offload processing to the GPU, which is capable of running many operations in parallel, potentially greatly increasing the speed of existing algorithms. The BCI system records many channels of data, which are processed and translated into a control signal, such as the movement of a computer cursor. This signal processing chain involves computing a matrix–matrix multiplication (i.e., a spatial filter), followed by calculating the power spectral density on every channel using an auto-regressive method, and finally classifying appropriate features for control. In this study, the first two computationally intensive steps were implemented on the GPU, and the speed was compared to both the current implementation and a central processing unit-based implementation that uses multi-threading. Significant performance gains were obtained with GPU processing: the current implementation processed 1000 channels of 250 ms in 933 ms, while the new GPU method took only 27 ms, an improvement of nearly 35 times.},

  abstract = {Information theory, the mathematical theory of communication in the presence of noise, is playing an increasingly important role in modern quantitative neuroscience. It makes it possible to treat neural systems as stochastic communication channels and gain valuable, quantitative insights into their sensory coding function. These techniques provide results on how neurons encode stimuli in a way which is independent of any specific assumptions on which part of the neuronal response is signal and which is noise, and they can be usefully applied even to highly non-linear systems where traditional techniques fail. In this article, we describe our work and experiences using Python for information theoretic analysis. We outline some of the algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the computation of information theoretic quantities from neural data. In particular, we consider the problems arising from limited sampling bias and from calculation of maximum entropy distributions in the presence of constraints representing the effects of different orders of interaction in the system. We explain how and why using Python has allowed us to significantly improve the speed and domain of applicability of the information theoretic algorithms, allowing analysis of data sets characterized by larger numbers of variables. We also discuss how our use of Python is facilitating integration with collaborative databases and centralised computational resources.},

  abstract = {Most patients suffering from psychiatric disorders respond to combinations of psycho- and psychopharmacotherapy; however there are patients who profit little if anything even after many years of treatment. Since about a decade different modalities of targeted neuromodulation – among them most prominently – deep brain stimulation (DBS) – are being actively researched as putative approaches to very treatment-resistant forms of those disorders. Recently, promising pilot data have been reported both for major depression (MD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Given the fact that patients included in DBS studies had been treated unsuccessfully for many years with conventional treatment methods, renders these findings remarkable. Remarkable is the fact, that in case of the long-term studies underway for MD, patients show a stable response. This gives hope to a substantial percentage of therapy–resistant psychiatric patients requiring new therapy approaches. There are no fundamental ethic objections to its use in psychiatric disorders, but until substantial clinical data is available, mandatory standards are needed. DBS is a unique and very promising method for the treatment of therapy–resistant psychiatric patients. The method allows manipulating pathological neuronal networks in a very precise way.},

  abstract = {Purpose Both frame-based and frameless approaches to deep brain stimulation (DBS) require planning of insertion trajectories that mitigate hemorrhagic risk and loss of neurological function. Currently, this is done by manual inspection of multiple potential electrode trajectories on MR-imaging data. We propose and validate a method for computer-assisted DBS trajectory planning. Method Our framework integrates multi-modal MRI analysis (T1w, SWI, TOF-MRA) to compute suitable DBS trajectories that optimize the avoidance of specific critical brain structures. A cylinder model is used to process each trajectory and to evaluate complex surgical constraints described via a combination of binary and fuzzy segmented datasets. The framework automatically aggregates the multiple constraints into a unique ranking of recommended low-risk trajectories. Candidate trajectories are represented as a few well-defined cortical entry patches of best-ranked trajectories and presented to the neurosurgeon for final trajectory selection. Results The proposed algorithm permits a search space containing over 8,000 possible trajectories to be processed in less than 20 s. A retrospective analysis on 14 DBS cases of patients with severe Parkinson’s disease reveals that our framework can improve the simultaneous optimization of many pre-formulated surgical constraints. Furthermore, all automatically computed trajectories were evaluated by two neurosurgeons, were judged suitable for surgery and, in many cases, were judged preferable or equivalent to the manually planned trajectories used during the operation. Conclusions This work provides neurosurgeons with an intuitive and flexible decision-support system that allows objective and patient-specific optimization of DBS lead trajectories, which should improve insertion safety and reduce surgical time.},

The resulting implants are an order of magnitude smaller than traditional recording electrodes, and more mechanically compliant with brain tissue. They were found to elicit much reduced chronic reactive tissue responses and enabled single-neuron recording in acute and early chronic experiments in rats.

  abstract   = {Recent years have seen neuroimaging data becoming richer, with larger cohorts of participants, a greater variety of acquisition techniques, and increasingly complex analyses. These advances have made data analysis pipelines complex to set up and run (increasing the risk of human error) and time consuming to execute (restricting what analyses are attempted). Here we present an open-source framework, automatic analysis (aa), to address these concerns. Human efficiency is increased by making code modular and reusable, and managing its execution with a processing engine that tracks what has been completed and what needs to be (re)done. Analysis is accelerated by optional parallel processing of independent tasks on cluster or cloud computing resources. A pipeline comprises a series of modules that each perform a specific task. The processing engine keeps track of the data, calculating a map of upstream and downstream dependencies for each module. Existing modules are available for many analysis tasks, such as SPM-based fMRI preprocessing, individual and group level statistics, voxel-based morphometry, tractography, and multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA). However, aa also allows for full customization, and encourages efficient management of code: new modules may be written with only a small code overhead. aa has been used by more than 50 researchers in hundreds of neuroimaging studies comprising thousands of subjects. It has been found to be robust, fast and efficient, for simple single subject studies up to multimodal pipelines on hundreds of subjects. It is attractive to both novice and experienced users. aa can reduce the amount of time neuroimaging laboratories spend performing analyses and reduce errors, expanding the range of scientific questions it is practical to address.},

  abstract   = {Technologies for silencing the electrical activity of genetically targeted neurons in the brain are important for assessing the contribution of specific cell types and pathways toward behaviors and pathologies. Recently we found that archaerhodopsin-3 from Halorubrum sodomense (Arch), a light-driven outward proton pump, when genetically expressed in neurons, enables them to be powerfully, transiently, and repeatedly silenced in response to pulses of light. Because of the impressive characteristics of Arch, we explored the optogenetic utility of opsins with high sequence homology to Arch, from archaea of the Halorubrum genus. We found that the archaerhodopsin from Halorubrum strain TP009, which we named ArchT, could mediate photocurrents of similar maximum amplitude to those of Arch (∼900 pA in vitro), but with a {\textgreater}3-fold improvement in light sensitivity over Arch, most notably in the optogenetic range of 1–10 mW/mm2, equating to {\textgreater}2× increase in brain tissue volume addressed by a typical single optical fiber. Upon expression in mouse or rhesus macaque cortical neurons, ArchT expressed well on neuronal membranes, including excellent trafficking for long distances down neuronal axons. The high light sensitivity prompted us to explore ArchT use in the cortex of the rhesus macaque. Optical perturbation of ArchT-expressing neurons in the brain of an awake rhesus macaque resulted in a rapid and complete (∼100\%) silencing of most recorded cells, with suppressed cells achieving a median firing rate of 0 spikes/s upon illumination. A small population of neurons showed increased firing rates at long latencies following the onset of light stimulation, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of network-level neural activity balancing. The powerful net suppression of activity suggests that ArchT silencing technology might be of great use not only in the causal analysis of neural circuits, but may have therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Objective. Chronic neural recording in behaving animals is an essential method for studies of neural circuit function. However, stable recordings from small, densely packed neurons remains challenging, particularly over time-scales relevant for learning. Approach. We describe an assembly method for a 16-channel electrode array consisting of carbon fibers ({\textless}5 µm diameter) individually insulated with Parylene-C and fire-sharpened. The diameter of the array is approximately 26 µm along the full extent of the implant. Main results. Carbon fiber arrays were tested in HVC (used as a proper name), a song motor nucleus, of singing zebra finches where individual neurons discharge with temporally precise patterns. Previous reports of activity in this population of neurons have required the use of high impedance electrodes on movable microdrives. Here, the carbon fiber electrodes provided stable multi-unit recordings over time-scales of months. Spike-sorting indicated that the multi-unit signals were dominated by one, or a small number of cells. Stable firing patterns during singing confirmed the stability of these clusters over time-scales of months. In addition, from a total of 10 surgeries, 16 projection neurons were found. This cell type is characterized by sparse stereotyped firing patterns, providing unambiguous confirmation of single cell recordings. Significance. Carbon fiber electrode bundles may provide a scalable solution for long-term neural recordings of densely packed neurons.},

  abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of human cognitive, sensory, and motor processes are usually based on noninvasive techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography or functional magnetic-resonance imaging. These techniques have either inherently low temporal or low spatial resolution, and suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and/or poor high-frequency sensitivity. Thus, they are suboptimal for exploring the short-lived spatio-temporal dynamics of many of the underlying brain processes. In contrast, the invasive technique of electrocorticography (ECoG) provides brain signals that have an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio, less susceptibility to artifacts than EEG, and a high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., {\textless}1 cm/{\textless}1 millisecond, respectively). ECoG involves measurement of electrical brain signals using electrodes that are implanted subdurally on the surface of the brain. Recent studies have shown that ECoG amplitudes in certain frequency bands carry substantial information about task-related activity, such as motor execution and planning, auditory processing and visual-spatial attention. Most of this information is captured in the high gamma range (around 70-110 Hz). Thus, gamma activity has been proposed as a robust and general indicator of local cortical function. ECoG can also reveal functional connectivity and resolve finer task-related spatial-temporal dynamics, thereby advancing our understanding of large-scale cortical processes. It has especially proven useful for advancing brain-computer interfacing (BCI) technology for decoding a user's intentions to enhance or improve communication and control. Nevertheless, human ECoG data are often hard to obtain because of the risks and limitations of the invasive procedures involved, and the need to record within the constraints of clinical settings. Still, clinical monitoring to localize epileptic foci offers a unique and valuable opportunity to collect human ECoG data. We describe our methods for collecting recording ECoG, and demonstrate how to use these signals for important real-time applications such as clinical mapping and brain-computer interfacing. Our example uses the BCI2000 software platform and the SIGFRIED method, an application for real-time mapping of brain functions. This procedure yields information that clinicians can subsequently use to guide the complex and laborious process of functional mapping by electrical stimulation. PREREQUISITES AND PLANNING: Patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy may be candidates for resective surgery of an epileptic focus to minimize the frequency of seizures. Prior to resection, the patients undergo monitoring using subdural electrodes for two purposes: first, to localize the epileptic focus, and second, to identify nearby critical brain areas (i.e., eloquent cortex) where resection could result in long-term functional deficits. To implant electrodes, a craniotomy is performed to open the skull. Then, electrode grids and/or strips are placed on the cortex, usually beneath the dura. A typical grid has a set of 8 x 8 platinum-iridium electrodes of 4 mm diameter (2.3 mm exposed surface) embedded in silicon with an inter-electrode distance of 1cm. A strip typically contains 4 or 6 such electrodes in a single line. The locations for these grids/strips are planned by a team of neurologists and neurosurgeons, and are based on previous EEG monitoring, on a structural MRI of the patient's brain, and on relevant factors of the patient's history. Continuous recording over a period of 5-12 days serves to localize epileptic foci, and electrical stimulation via the implanted electrodes allows clinicians to map eloquent cortex. At the end of the monitoring period, explantation of the electrodes and therapeutic resection are performed together in one procedure. In addition to its primary clinical purpose, invasive monitoring also provides a unique opportunity to acquire human ECoG data for neuroscientific research. The decision to include a prospective patient in the research is based on the planned location of their electrodes, on the patient's performance scores on neuropsychological assessments, and on their informed consent, which is predicated on their understanding that participation in research is optional and is not related to their treatment. As with all research involving human subjects, the research protocol must be approved by the hospital's institutional review board. The decision to perform individual experimental tasks is made day-by-day, and is contingent on the patient's endurance and willingness to participate. Some or all of the experiments may be prevented by problems with the clinical state of the patient, such as post-operative facial swelling, temporary aphasia, frequent seizures, post-ictal fatigue and confusion, and more general pain or discomfort. At the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York, clinical monitoring is implemented around the clock using a 192-channel Nihon-Kohden Neurofax monitoring system. Research recordings are made in collaboration with the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health in Albany. Signals from the ECoG electrodes are fed simultaneously to the research and the clinical systems via splitter connectors. To ensure that the clinical and research systems do not interfere with each other, the two systems typically use separate grounds. In fact, an epidural strip of electrodes is sometimes implanted to provide a ground for the clinical system. Whether research or clinical recording system, the grounding electrode is chosen to be distant from the predicted epileptic focus and from cortical areas of interest for the research. Our research system consists of eight synchronized 16-channel g.USBamp amplifier/digitizer units (g.tec, Graz, Austria). These were chosen because they are safety-rated and FDA-approved for invasive recordings, they have a very low noise-floor in the high-frequency range in which the signals of interest are found, and they come with an SDK that allows them to be integrated with custom-written research software. In order to capture the high-gamma signal accurately, we acquire signals at 1200Hz sampling rate-considerably higher than that of the typical EEG experiment or that of many clinical monitoring systems. A built-in low-pass filter automatically prevents aliasing of signals higher than the digitizer can capture. The patient's eye gaze is tracked using a monitor with a built-in Tobii T-60 eye-tracking system (Tobii Tech., Stockholm, Sweden). Additional accessories such as joystick, bluetooth Wiimote (Nintendo Co.), data-glove (5(th) Dimension Technologies), keyboard, microphone, headphones, or video camera are connected depending on the requirements of the particular experiment. Data collection, stimulus presentation, synchronization with the different input/output accessories, and real-time analysis and visualization are accomplished using our BCI2000 software. BCI2000 is a freely available general-purpose software system for real-time biosignal data acquisition, processing and feedback. It includes an array of pre-built modules that can be flexibly configured for many different purposes, and that can be extended by researchers' own code in C++, MATLAB or Python. BCI2000 consists of four modules that communicate with each other via a network-capable protocol: a Source module that handles the acquisition of brain signals from one of 19 different hardware systems from different manufacturers; a Signal Processing module that extracts relevant ECoG features and translates them into output signals; an Application module that delivers stimuli and feedback to the subject; and the Operator module that provides a graphical interface to the investigator. A number of different experiments may be conducted with any given patient. The priority of experiments will be determined by the location of the particular patient's electrodes. However, we usually begin our experimentation using the SIGFRIED (SIGnal modeling For Realtime Identification and Event Detection) mapping method, which detects and displays significant task-related activity in real time. The resulting functional map allows us to further tailor subsequent experimental protocols and may also prove as a useful starting point for traditional mapping by electrocortical stimulation (ECS). Although ECS mapping remains the gold standard for predicting the clinical outcome of resection, the process of ECS mapping is time consuming and also has other problems, such as after-discharges or seizures. Thus, a passive functional mapping technique may prove valuable in providing an initial estimate of the locus of eloquent cortex, which may then be confirmed and refined by ECS. The results from our passive SIGFRIED mapping technique have been shown to exhibit substantial concurrence with the results derived using ECS mapping. The protocol described in this paper establishes a general methodology for gathering human ECoG data, before proceeding to illustrate how experiments can be initiated using the BCI2000 software platform. Finally, as a specific example, we describe how to perform passive functional mapping using the BCI2000-based SIGFRIED system.},

Each barreloid projects to its associated cortical barrel column and so forms a gateway for incoming sensory stimuli to the barrel cortex. We aimed to determine how the population of neurons within one barreloid encodes naturalistic whisker motion. In rats, we recorded the extracellular activity of up to nine single neurons within a single barreloid, by implanting silicon probes parallel to the longitudinal axis of the barreloids. We found that play-back of texture-induced whisker motion evoked sparse responses, timed with millisecond precision. At the population level, there was synchronous activity: however, different subsets of neurons were synchronously active at different times. Mutual information between population responses and whisker motion increased near linearly with population size. When normalized to factor out firing rate differences, we found that texture was encoded with greater informational-efficiency than white noise. These results indicate that, within each VPM barreloid, there is a rich and efficient population code for naturalistic whisker motion based on precisely timed, population spike patterns.},

We here describe the ability to make specific neurons in the brain light-sensitive, using a viral approach. We also reveal the design and construction of a scalable, fully-implantable optical prosthetic capable of delivering light of appropriate intensity and wavelength to targeted neurons at arbitrary 3-D locations within the brain, enabling activation and silencing of specific neuron types at multiple locations. Finally, we demonstrate control of neural activity in the cortex of the non-human primate, a key step in the translation of such technology for human clinical use.

  abstract  = {The encoding of sensory information by populations of cortical neurons forms the basis for perception but remains poorly understood. To understand the constraints of cortical population coding we analyzed neural responses to natural sounds recorded in auditory cortex of primates (Macaca mulatta). We estimated stimulus information while varying the composition and size of the considered population. Consistent with previous reports we found that when choosing subpopulations randomly from the recorded ensemble, the average population information increases steadily with population size. This scaling was explained by a model assuming that each neuron carried equal amounts of information, and that any overlap between the information carried by each neuron arises purely from random sampling within the stimulus space. However, when studying subpopulations selected to optimize information for each given population size, the scaling of information was strikingly different: a small fraction of temporally precise cells carried the vast majority of information. This scaling could be explained by an extended model, assuming that the amount of information carried by individual neurons was highly nonuniform, with few neurons carrying large amounts of information. Importantly, these optimal populations can be determined by a single biophysical marker—the neuron's encoding time scale—allowing their detection and readout within biologically realistic circuits. These results show that extrapolations of population information based on random ensembles may overestimate the population size required for stimulus encoding, and that sensory cortical circuits may process information using small but highly informative ensembles.},

  abstract = {Information theory is a practical and theoretical framework developed for the study of communication over noisy channels. Its probabilistic basis and capacity to relate statistical structure to function make it ideally suited for studying information flow in the nervous system. It has a number of useful properties: it is a general measure sensitive to any relationship, not only linear effects; it has meaningful units which in many cases allow direct comparison between different experiments; and it can be used to study how much information can be gained by observing neural responses in single trials, rather than in averages over multiple trials. A variety of information theoretic quantities are in common use in neuroscience - (see entry "Summary of Information-Theoretic Quantities"). Estimating these quantities in an accurate and unbiased way from real neurophysiological data frequently presents challenges, which are explained in this entry.},

Functionality of this package includes correction of motion artifacts occurring during in vivo imaging with laser-scanning microscopy, segmentation of imaged fields into regions of interest (ROIs), and extraction of signals from the segmented ROIs. We have also developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for manual editing of the automatically segmented ROIs and automated registration of ROIs across multiple imaging datasets. This software has been designed with flexibility in mind to allow for future extension with different analysis methods and potential integration with other packages.

Here we show the efficacy of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched allogeneic neural cell grafting in the brain, which is considered a less immune-responsive tissue, using iPSCs derived from an MHC homozygous cynomolgus macaque. Positron emission tomography imaging reveals neuroinflammation associated with an immune response against MHC-mismatched grafted cells. Immunohistological analyses reveal that MHC-matching reduces the immune response by suppressing the accumulation of microglia (Iba-1+) and lymphocytes (CD45+) into the grafts. Consequently, MHC-matching increases the survival of grafted dopamine neurons (tyrosine hydroxylase: TH+). The effect of an immunosuppressant, Tacrolimus, is also confirmed in the same experimental setting. Our results demonstrate the rationale for MHC-matching in neural cell grafting to the brain and its feasibility in a clinical setting. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) matching improves graft survival rates after organ transplantation. Here the authors show that in macaques, MHC-matched iPSC-derived neurons provide better engraftment in the brain, with a lower immune response and higher survival of the transplanted neurons.},

The necessity to analyze large volumetric data sets accurately, efficiently, and in true 3D has been a major bottleneck in deriving reliable relationships between altered neuronal function and changes in spine morphology. We introduce a novel system for automated detection, shape analysis and classification of dendritic spines from laser scanning microscopy (LSM) images that directly addresses these limitations. The system is more accurate, and at least an order of magnitude faster, than existing technologies. By operating fully in 3D the algorithm resolves spines that are undetectable with standard two-dimensional (2D) tools. Adaptive local thresholding, voxel clustering and Rayburst Sampling generate a profile of diameter estimates used to classify spines into morphologic types, while minimizing optical smear and quantization artifacts.

Successful application of two-photon imaging with genetic tools in awake macaque monkeys will enable fundamental advances in our understanding of higher cognitive function at the level of molecular and neuronal circuits. Here we report techniques for long-term two-photon imaging in awake macaque monkeys. Using genetically encoded indicators including GCaMP5 and GCaMP6s delivered by AAV2/1 into the visual cortex, we demonstrate that high-quality two-photon imaging of large neuronal populations can be achieved and maintained in awake monkeys for months. Simultaneous intracellular recording and two-photon calcium imaging confirm that fluorescence activity is linearly proportional to neuronal spiking activity across a wide range of firing rates (10 Hz to 150 Hz). By providing two-photon imaging access to cortical neuronal populations at single-cell or single dendritic spine resolution in awake monkeys, the techniques reported can help bridge the use of modern genetic and molecular tools and the study of higher cognitive function.},

  abstract = {Brains are restless. We have long known of the existence of a great deal of uninterrupted brain activity that maintains the body in a stable state — from an evolutionary standpoint one of the brain's most ancient tasks. But intrinsic, ongoing activity is not limited to subcortical, life-maintaining structures; cortex, too, is remarkably active even in the absence of a sensory stimulus or a specific behavioral task. This is evident both in its enormous energy consumption at rest and in the large, spontaneous but coherent fluctuations of neural activity that spread across different areas. Not surprisingly, a growing number of electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are appearing that report on various aspects of the brain's spontaneous activity or “default mode” of operation. One recent study reports results from simultaneously combined electrophysiological and fMRI measurements in the monkey visual cortex (Shmuel, A., Leopold, D.A., 2008. Neuronal correlates of spontaneous fluctuations in fMRI signals in monkey visual cortex: implications for functional connectivity at rest. Hum. Brain Mapp. 29, 751–761). The authors claim to be able to demonstrate correlations between slow fluctuations in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying, locally measured neuronal activity. They even go on to speculate that the fluctuations display wave-like spatiotemporal patterns across cortex. In the present report, however, we re-analyze the data presented in that study and demonstrate that the measurements were not actually taken during rest. Visual cortex was subject to almost imperceptible but physiologically clearly detectable flicker induced by the visual stimulator. An examination of the power spectral density of the neural responses and the neurovascular impulse response function shows that such imperceptible flicker strongly suppresses the slow oscillations and changes the degree of covariance between neural and vascular signals. In addition, a careful analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns demonstrates that no slow waves of activity exist in visual cortex; instead, the presented wave data reflect differences in signal-to-noise ratio at various cortical sites due to local differences in vascularization. In this report, assuming that the term “spontaneous activity” refers to intrinsic physiological processes at the absence of sensory inputs or motor outputs, we discuss the need for careful selection of experimental protocols and of examining the degree to which the activation of sensory areas might influence the cortical or subcortical processes in other brain regions.},

  abstract = {Energy is an important consideration in the design and deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) since sensor nodes are typically powered by batteries with limited capacity. Since the communication unit on a wireless sensor node is the major power consumer, data compression is one of possible techniques that can help reduce the amount of data exchanged between wireless sensor nodes resulting in power saving. However, wireless sensor networks possess significant limitations in communication, processing, storage, bandwidth, and power. Thus, any data compression scheme proposed for WSNs must be lightweight. In this paper, we present an adaptive lossless data compression (ALDC) algorithm for wireless sensor networks. Our proposed ALDC scheme performs compression losslessly using multiple code options. Adaptive compression schemes allow compression to dynamically adjust to a changing source. The data sequence to be compressed is partitioned into blocks, and the optimal compression scheme is applied for each block. Using various real-world sensor datasets we demonstrate the merits of our proposed compression algorithm in comparison with other recently proposed lossless compression algorithms for WSNs.},

We introduce the Java Information Dynamics Toolkit (JIDT): a Google code project which provides a standalone, (GNU GPL v3 licensed) open-source code implementation for empirical estimation of information-theoretic measures from time-series data. While the toolkit provides classic information-theoretic measures (e.g. entropy, mutual information, conditional mutual information), it ultimately focusses on implementing higher-level measures for information dynamics. That is, JIDT focusses on quantifying information storage, transfer and modification, and the dynamics of these operations in space and time. For this purpose, it includes implementations of the transfer entropy and active information storage, their multivariate extensions and local or pointwise variants. JIDT provides implementations for both discrete and continuous-valued data for each measure, including various types of estimator for continuous data (e.g. Gaussian, box-kernel and Kraskov-Stoegbauer-Grassberger) which can be swapped at run-time due to Java's object-oriented polymorphism. Furthermore, while written in Java, the toolkit can be used directly in MATLAB, GNU Octave, Python and other environments. We present the principles behind the code design, and provide several examples to guide users.},

  abstract  = {The problem of how to properly quantify redundant information is an open question that has been the subject of much recent research. Redundant information refers to information about a target variable S that is common to two or more predictor variables     X i    . It can be thought of as quantifying overlapping information content or similarities in the representation of S between the     X i    . We present a new measure of redundancy which measures the common change in surprisal shared between variables at the local or pointwise level. We provide a game-theoretic operational definition of unique information, and use this to derive constraints which are used to obtain a maximum entropy distribution. Redundancy is then calculated from this maximum entropy distribution by counting only those local co-information terms which admit an unambiguous interpretation as redundant information. We show how this redundancy measure can be used within the framework of the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to give an intuitive decomposition of the multivariate mutual information into redundant, unique and synergistic contributions. We compare our new measure to existing approaches over a range of example systems, including continuous Gaussian variables. Matlab code for the measure is provided, including all considered examples.},

  abstract = {We begin by reviewing the statistical framework of information theory as applicable to neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework in neuroimaging is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables. This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, unidimensional and multidimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We also present examples of analyses facilitated by these developments, including application of multivariate analyses to MEG planar magnetic field gradients, and pairwise temporal interactions in evoked EEG responses. We show the benefit of considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG signals as a multivariate response, how we can separately quantify modulations of amplitude and direction for vector quantities, and how we can measure the emergence of novel information over time in evoked responses.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Transfer entropy (TE) is a measure for the detection of directed interactions. Transfer entropy is an information theoretic implementation of Wiener's principle of observational causality. It offers an approach to the detection of neuronal interactions that is free of an explicit model of the interactions. Hence, it offers the power to analyze linear and nonlinear interactions alike. This allows for example the comprehensive analysis of directed interactions in neural networks at various levels of description. Here we present the open-source MATLAB toolbox TRENTOOL that allows the user to handle the considerable complexity of this measure and to validate the obtained results using non-parametrical statistical testing. We demonstrate the use of the toolbox and the performance of the algorithm on simulated data with nonlinear (quadratic) coupling and on local field potentials (LFP) recorded from the retina and the optic tectum of the turtle (Pseudemys scripta elegans) where a neuronal one-way connection is likely present.
RESULTS: In simulated data TE detected information flow in the simulated direction reliably with false positives not exceeding the rates expected under the null hypothesis. In the LFP data we found directed interactions from the retina to the tectum, despite the complicated signal transformations between these stages. No false positive interactions in the reverse directions were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: TRENTOOL is an implementation of transfer entropy and mutual information analysis that aims to support the user in the application of this information theoretic measure. TRENTOOL is implemented as a MATLAB toolbox and available under an open source license (GPL v3). For the use with neural data TRENTOOL seamlessly integrates with the popular FieldTrip toolbox.},

  abstract = {Population coding is the quantitative study of which algorithms or representations are used by the brain to combine together and evaluate the messages carried by different neurons. Here, we review an information-theoretic approach to population coding. We first discuss how to compute the information carried by simultaneously recorded neural populations, and in particular how to reduce the limited sampling bias which affects the calculation of information from a limited amount of experimental data. We then discuss how to quantify the contribution of individual members of the population, or the interaction between them, to the overall information encoded by the considered group of neurons. We focus in particular on evaluating what is the contribution of interactions up to any given order to the total information. We illustrate this formalism with applications to simulated data with realistic neuronal statistics and to real simultaneous recordings of multiple spike trains.},

The successful planning and execution of adaptive behaviors in mammals may require long-range coordination of neural networks throughout cerebral cortex. The neuronal implementation of signals that could orchestrate cortex-wide activity remains unclear. Here, we develop and apply methods for cortex-wide Ca2+ imaging in mice performing decision-making behavior and identify a global cortical representation of task engagement encoded in the activity dynamics of both single cells and superficial neuropil distributed across the majority of dorsal cortex. The activity of multiple molecularly defined cell types was found to reflect this representation with type-specific dynamics. Focal optogenetic inhibition tiled across cortex revealed a crucial role for frontal cortex in triggering this cortex-wide phenomenon; local inhibition of this region blocked both the cortex-wide response to task-initiating cues and the voluntary behavior. These findings reveal cell-type-specific processes in cortex for globally representing goal-directed behavior and identify a major cortical node that gates the global broadcast of task-related information.},
