## Data Scaling

This section describes the reality of how data scales as more and more sensors are added. Typically we humans think linearly, but the ramifications of increasing something like sensor size is often exponential. Furthermore, many operations we perform have costs that scale exponentially, and in my humble opinion are not even worth attempting if any such procedure must applied continuously on a data=stream.
