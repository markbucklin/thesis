# Project Prologue
This chapter describes several projects that were started early during my graduate studies. Each project is similar in that they are outside the realm of optical imaging of neural activity, which is the focus of the rest of this dissertation. Nevertheless, they are included here because the issues they bring up will later inform the approach I take in the work described in later chapters. The projects described in the following sections are also tied together by a common goal: to enable research in the neurosciences with translation potential for clinical applications.

## Technology Development Background for the Study Brain Function and Treatment of Neurological Disorders

-   Electrophysiology, Histology, Functional brain imaging
    -   pros/cons of each
    -   very little compromise in tradeoffs
-   Filling the gaps between these three approaches
