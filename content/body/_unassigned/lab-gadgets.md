Motivation:
 - slash costs
 - expand capabilities
 - extend useful lifetime

Selection, design, development:
 - consider/ensure the inclusion of features that will minimize development time, maintenance costs, and the cost to translate or adapt for other uses beyond the scope of the initial project.
 - beginning with Open Source Hardware will cut costs tremendously, moreover sticking with open source software has a tremendous advantage in decreasing both development time and future send ability as the availability of existing Solutions and examples on the internet far outweighs that a proprietary software, and will only continue to grow. Keeping with open source software Frameworks and or apis will also have a performance advantage as continued development of their underline implementation can be incorporated with minimal extended development effort,   especially if procedures for testing, benchmarking, and repackaging are fully integrated from the beginning of the development process.
