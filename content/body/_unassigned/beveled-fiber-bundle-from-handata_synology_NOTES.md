##### beveled fiber bundle notes
This experiment was performed in an effort to further characterize the beveled fiber bundle, and also to test the full-field limits of the new sCMOS camera.

The mouse used was provided by KK. Transgenic EMX-Cre crossed with an Arch strain (EMX-Arch), thus all pyramidal neurons are expressing Archaerhodopsin along with GFP. This may be far from the sparse labeling we suspect would work with the beveled fiber bundle.

The mouse was sedated with ip injections of a ketamine/xylazine mix (8mg/ml & 1.5mg/ml) as needed (approximately .1ml/hr after loading dose of .2ml). headplated mouse fixed on the VR-ball, running prior to being sedated and skull opened.

Dental cement removed with a pneumatic drill. Craniotomy between existing skull-screws, approx 1.5mm X 2.5mm. Bleeding was minimal, flushed with saline. Dura was examined and trimmed along edges of craniotomy.

Tried whole-field imaging first with 10x objective and was amazed with results. No fluorescence changes (as expected), but fluorescent background showed fantastic flow of RBCs through capillaries. Image sequences were taken in a single plane and while moving along z-axis (focusing with siskiyou motorized hackjob). Also tried whole-field imaging with 20x objective, with comparatively disappointing results.

Moved on to attempting to image through fiber bundle (fixed at focus of 20x objective lens). Unfortunately the fiber bundle is not sticking out far enough past the xy-cage-mount-translation stage that holds it. After penetrating just a few hundred microns the stage collided with the headplate-holder and began shifting with focus and also pushing the fiber bundle out of the center of the image. May try again. Or more likely will sacrifice this mouse and move on to the GCamP-expressing mouse, which might actually show dynamics.
