# Goals for Fellowship Training and Career 

I'll be developing my skills in engineering and neuroscience, as well as my computation skills over the next one to two years. I also plan to enroll in metalworking and nanofabrication classes. I plan to stay active in the biomedical engineering, and neuroscience communities here in Boston, and certainly intend to keep my *medical skills* fresh by staying in touch with colleagues from Boston University Medical School, from the MD/PhD community by continuing to go to the Monday night talks, the interview dinners, as well as the annual retreat. I would like to take two weeks this February 2014 to travel with the Hancock County Medical Mission on their annual trip to Ecuador. The last time I went I had been a licensed EMT for approximately one month, and I was eighteen years old. Nevertheless I was closing for the surgeon by the second week there.

I am also planning a medical trip to China with Dr. Ming Cheng. He travels to China several times each year to implant Deep Brain Stimulators, and check up on past patients. It would be a great opportuntitiy for me to see the day-in-day-out, and to get training in neurosurgery.

While neurosurgery is exhilerating, I feel the 7-year residency may be too long and too demanding, and would disrupt my desire to continue building experimental technology for biomedical applications. One program I'm considering is the Clinical Neuroscientist Training Program (CNSTP) at Yale, which is a mixed neurology/neuroscience program. This postdoctoral training or something similar would be ideal.
