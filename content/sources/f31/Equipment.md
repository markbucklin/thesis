**Major Items Available**

I have access to all equipment necessary to carry this project. Dr. Han's workshop space has a great workshop with access to many tools, including a bandsaw, a CNC-mill, drills, and more. Boston University's Biomedical Engineering core facilities provide access to grad students. Optogenetic manipulations will be performed with LEDs that are fully accessible optical fiber and associated fiber connectors. I also have full access to our laboratory's mill and assortment of materials for building behavior apparatus (silinoids, tubing, phototransistors, sound proofing foam, etc.). All surgical equipment necessary to perform the survival surgeries described are currently available in Dr. Han's laboratory including 2 surgery tables, filters, air ventilation etc. Finally, through Dr. Han's Laboratory and the core facilities I have access to a cryostat, epifluorescence microscope, and confocal microscope for histology.
