## Cameras for Widefield Microscopy

Traditional widefield microscope or macroscope builds incorporate 'scientific grade' cameras. Compared to cameras built for other markets (e.g. consumer, industrial, studio, etc.), these cameras are often well tested and certified to offer low or well-characterised noise at moderate speeds, and a linear photo-response profile. Unlike consumer or studio cameras which are invaribaly configured for RGB color, they are preferably configured with 'monochrome' sensors - essentially identical to the analagous color sensor, without the bayer filter. Of much greater importance, one must consider the unique connectivity and control interface that scientific cameras come with. Standards exist, but are typically unique to this segment of the industry, with poorly defined specifications for translation to other electronic communication and connection interface standards, such as those used in studio and broadcast video, or those used with consumer cameras. The trait that is the most worthy of consideration, however, is the cost. See @discussion-cost-consumer for details.

The in-vivo instrinsic-signal or fluorescent-dye imaging camera of 1 decade ago had a 0.5"-1" monochrome CCD sensor with 0.1-1 MegaPixels, a large well-depth, and moderately low noise at speeds around 30 to 60 fps. Connection was often LVDS, with custom electrial connectors unique to each camera. A particularly popular and long-running model was the Dalsa 1M30, followed by the 1M60 in later years [@takahashi_vivo_2006].
