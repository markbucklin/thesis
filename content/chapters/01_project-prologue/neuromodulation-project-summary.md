### Project Summary

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been used clinically since the early 1990’s, and is currently approved by the FDA for treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and essential tremor, with Humanitarian Device Exemptions for OCD and dystonia. However, benefits of DBS treatment are unpredictable and show varying degrees and patterns of symptom suppression across patients. This is likely partly due to a need for neural implant devices capable of more numerous and specific stimulation contact areas, as well as a lack of knowledge regarding DBS mechanism of action. There is growing evidence, that suggests that increases in synchronized oscillatory activity in certain brain circuits represent a pathologic and moreover symptomatic state in PD, the disruption of which is believed to yield the beneficial effects of DBS. Likewise, this abnormal synchronization is a mechanism for numerous other common neurologic and psychiatric disorders that include epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorder and depression. The central goal of this project is to develop a novel adaptive neuromodulation platform that increases both the number of neural contacts and the specificity of their location as compared with DBS in order to create a more effective and targeted treatment alternative, and in the process to examine DBS therapeutic mechanisms. Development of such an alternative has far reaching implications including improved patient symptoms, fewer surgical procedures and broader application across patient populations. To reach Aim 1, a bidirectional neural interface with penetrating silicon electrodes capable of simultaneously recording from multiple sites of the Parkinson’s mouse model intracranially. Such a device would be developed and interspersed with LED-coupled optical-fibers for multi-point optogenetic neuromodulation. To perform neuromodulation with high spatiotemporal precision, optogenetic methods would be used to activate or silence specific neurons expressing rhodopsins in mice using certain colors of light. For Aim 2, machine-learning algorithms would implement a library of optimized strategies to efficiently determine the neural network states responsible for a specific disease condition using a closed-loop control system and a second slower, more complex routine routine that records and analyzes the streams of neural and behavioral data, and assesses the performance of state-estimates and controls applied by the real-time component. The neural network states identified in Aim 2 are expected to conform and converge into distinct archetypes, such as beta oscillations, within the cortical-basal gangion circuits outside of the classical PD neural circuit. Once proven correct, the proposed therapeutic mechanisms of DBS through altering neural network pathological representations would provide a basis for a new generation of neural circuit based neuromodulation therapies.
