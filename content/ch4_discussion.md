## Points to Address

-   "Biomimicry" in Visual Processing
    -   This section describes how image and video processing in the computer relate to visual processing in the mammalian brain. The overall goal is to emphasize the advantage and importance of biomimetic development.
    -   Neuromorphic computing
        -   On chip image processing
            -   relation "edge computing"
        -   event-based image sensors
            -   "Artificial retina"
            -   tittto
            -   situations where event streams are advantageous
            -   asynchronous
            -   threshold-based
        -   convolutional neural-nets and deep learning for specific tasks
            -   similarities
            -   differences (substantial)
        -   genetic programming approaches to procedure optimization
            -   minimize latency
            -   maximize sensitivity and accuracy
            -   minimize computational cost
                -   minimize energy expenditure (metabolic efficiency)
    -   Visual stream processing
        -   feature extraction
        -   motion estimation and compensation
    -   Asymmetry of learning/training time and desired inference computation time
-   Common themes across projects
    -   finding common standards
        -   sticking to non-proprietary *open source* conventions
            -   optical parts (lens threads)
            -   file formats
            -   software libraries
            -   programming languages
        -   file transmission
            -   web-based
    -   Borrow from related sectors
        -   better developed in many cases
        -   surveillance
        -   media streaming for web/entertainment
        -   sports
        -   astronomy/telescopes
        -   medical imaging
        -   automotive

# lab gadgets

Motivation:
 - slash costs
 - expand capabilities
 - extend useful lifetime

Selection, design, development:
 - consider/ensure the inclusion of features that will minimize development time, maintenance costs, and the cost to translate or adapt for other uses beyond the scope of the initial project.
 - beginning with Open Source Hardware will cut costs tremendously, moreover sticking with open source software has a tremendous advantage in decreasing both development time and future send ability as the availability of existing Solutions and examples on the internet far outweighs that a proprietary software, and will only continue to grow. Keeping with open source software Frameworks and or apis will also have a performance advantage as continued development of their underline implementation can be incorporated with minimal extended development effort,   especially if procedures for testing, benchmarking, and repackaging are fully integrated from the beginning of the development process.

# Discussion (draft)

This is a draft of the discussion dictated on my phone in a small notes program. The Thesis will have 2 discussion sections, the first following the initial microscope hardware and image processing software sections which are largely completed at this time, and II at the end of the document.

## Middle Discussion

### Assessment of Long-Term Viability of Current Approach


## Closing Discussion



### unintentionally neuromorphic

I wish to discuss a few other parallels that aren't as obvious for as relevant to the planning and approach of the software, which is why they have not been brought up before but included here because they're interesting regardless, especially from a neuroscience perspective.
