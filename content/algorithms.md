Mark Bucklin Dissertation Alogrithims


  

**Plan A**: Insert animated GIF link for each video

**Plan B:** Insert a single static image as a thumbnail image series (*and provide link to video if permitted*)


  

***Algo #1: Video Preprocessing***

​	Figures (use “pretest” figure)

​	Text (select from multiple examples; limit to 1-2 paragraphs)

​	Code snipit (use 1 piece of code to describe 1 step in video pre-processing)


  

***Algo #2:  Motion Correction***

​	Figures (use presentation figures; use “overlay video” showing image corrected for motion

​	Add traces (plots) of “points of interest” of correction that were actually corrected to illustrate the magnitude of image correction

​	Text (choose from either Prospectus text or published manuscript in Frontiers; cut and paste best 1-2 paragraphs)

​	Code (Use basic only, about 3 lines of example code)


  

***Algo #3: Feature Generation*** (focus on “*Orthagonal Correction*”)

​	Figures: Select from sequential statistics

​	Text (“exists but must find it”; cut and paste best 1-2 paragraphs)

​	Code snipit: (update pixel features using images including curvature images, normalized point use mutual info (currently exists as a video)
