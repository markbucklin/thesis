## Distributed Dataflow and Streaming




### Language: Is MATLAB the best tool for this job?
- Standard language in many engineering programs
- Proprietary
- Performance
- Compatibility
- Need for a "SandBox"
- Lacks modularity
- 

### Alternatives Languages
- Python
- C/C++
- Java/Scala
- Javascript/Node
- GO, Haskell


### Databases


### Big Data 
- not exactly\... 
- disparate simple queries across

### Computational Models
- Dataflow Processing 
- Actors model
- Petri Nets 
- Graph Processing 
      - i.e. Tensorflow
