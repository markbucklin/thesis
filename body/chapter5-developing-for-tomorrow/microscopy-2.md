This section details the evolution of cameras sensors and other sensors that provide bio-relevant data. Emphasis is on

### Scientific CMOS (sCMOS)

-   Correlated double sampling
-   HDR
-   On-sensor Fusion
-   Commercial availability

### Data-Transfer (Camera Interfaces)

-   USB
-   CameraLink
-   COaXPress
-   PCIe
    -   gen2, gen3
    -   x4, x8
    -   copper, fiber

## Image Acquisition

-   Libraries
-   Camera configuration
