## Photo Absorption and Thermal Dissipation in Brain Tissue Optogenetics

This was a modeling project. <!-- TODO -->

<!-- ## Closed-Loop Optogenetic Neuromodulation -->
<!-- (Deep-Target Carbon-Fiber Electrode Array and Bilateral Illumination) -->
## Behavior Box

<!--  2011 -->
Files in this folder are used to run our "BehaviorBox" system, which features easily customizable control of experiments involving an infrared touchscreen and LCD display along with speakers, water-ports, lights, essentially anything that can be controlled electronically...

COGENT 2000 The graphics/visual-stimulation package used is missing from this folder due to size, but can be downloaded from the source (http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent\_2000.php)

### IR Touchscreen

IRTouch Serial Protocol 1105

### FrameSynx Toolbox

The FrameSynx toolbox for MATLAB was built to synchronize continuous image acquisition with experiments conducted in the neuroscience laboratory setting. While the experiments are conducted in separate software (and potentially on a different computer), FrameSynx listens for messages to start/stop the experiment, start a trial, etc. and responds accordingly by controlling one or multiple cameras and illumination devices, and synchronizing this information with the data acquired.
