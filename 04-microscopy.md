## Microscopy

This section describes the background in microscopy in the neurosciences, and also how it relates to imaging in healthcare and electrophysiology in neuroscience. It will also describe the basic elements necessary for the construction of a microscope in a laboratory where calcium imaging in an animal is available. It will also refer to later sections which cover the design and construction of mechanical elements for animal handling and optical access (i.e. the headplate and a chronic optical window).
